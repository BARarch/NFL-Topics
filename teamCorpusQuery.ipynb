       "{37: 'Besides the fact that the Redskins starters will get a final extended opportunity on the field this Sunday this week has been helpful in getting players and coaches back to a game routine While the first couple of preseason games can occasionally offer a window into how the regular season will play out for a given team more often it extrapolates small amounts of data and churns them through a hype machine that creates a narrative mostly forgotten by the first week in September The third game however otherwise known as the final dress rehearsal for the firstteam offense and defense gives a sizeable chunk of playing time to the starters providing one last chance to find a rhythm before the opener For the Redskins this comes on a Sunday which means that the past several days have functioned like a regular game week In other words in opposition to the previous two games against the Ravens and Packers Redskins players have gameplanned for their upcoming opponent the Cincinnati Bengals like they would a regular season game getting back into the habit of a threeday practice schedule and watching film with their position groups For the first time this preseason theyll actually have an idea of what to expect when they jog onto the field This week is big running back Chris Thompson said We get to focus on our opponent a lot this week and not so much our offense going against our defense getting some really good looks out there We got to see a lot of Cincinnati last year so it helps to be able to go back and look at that film also because these first two games theyve had a lot of injuries and their starters havent put in a lot of time either Its just been big for us to go watch film and look at some things that they do well and just try to find out best way to execute This is a way of saying that all of the panic regarding the slow offensive starts and unproductive run game should be tempered The Redskins havent concerned themselves too much with preparing for opponents in which starters barely play and backups make the majority of highlights Defenses try out blitz schemes and offenses mostly react the best they can Were going to be fine wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr said earlier this week Everyone goes through a process where you dont really break down the defense You look at the Giants for example Did they look any more spectacular than us And their offense is going to be good I dont care what you say So theres little things that youve got to iron outRight now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday That optimism stems from the fact that the Redskins are hoping to have everyone on offense together on the field for the first time since offseason practices as tight end Jordan Reed returned from the PUP list earlier this week and Josh Doctson looked sharp in his limited action against Green Bay Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh said Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter Aside from getting in sync on the field for an extended amount of time the week of preparation from a filmwatching and installation standpoint remains important The majority of training camp is spent watching tape of teammates which only helps so much With a full week of studying an opposing team players start exercising their mental muscles again adjusting to the routines of the week Just like anything else you take off from practice or if youre away from the game for a little while you come back youre a little rusty have to get your feet under you and just like watching film tight end Vernon Davis said We watch film all the time in training camp we watch each other we watch the plays so it all comes together its not much of a difference its just that youre getting in that habit getting in that room where youre accustomed to doing those things The same goes for the coaching staff which has shuffled around a bit with the promotion of Cavanaugh who has learned how to delegate certain responsibilities to other coaches and given them a good idea of how the regular season will function day to day Its been helpful for the players too I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Cavanaugh said Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the real things going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff Its hard to appreciate the impact of establishing a routine over results but the Redskins are hoping the latter will come because of the former Theres still some time to fix things Cavanaugh said and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes',\n",
       " 54: 'Entering his fourth year with the Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy has never been more comfortable and confident in his career As he prepares for another season McCoy reflects on his time in Texas going through adversity and taking pride in an unheralded role How cool was it to have both of your daughters watch you at training camp this year It was cool It was the first time my family had come to training camp have two little girls and that was a nice breakup to camp see them after practice let them run around for a little bit Kids are such a blessing Its fun to let them see their dad at work I spend so much time here kind of get a glimpse of what I do even though theyre not really old enough to understand yet its just fun to have them around So that was the first time they both saw you on the field Yeah I think so Whats it like having two daughters now Its awesome its work Kids are great but they require a lot of time My wifes a saint she does a great job with them The time that I do get to spend with them I cherish it And you had a full offseason to see your second daughter grow up Yeah I was there for all the dirty work Whens the last time you had to buy yourself a drink in Austin Texas Not very often People in Texas are great Its pretty neat to be able to go back there for a month or so during the offseason and see family and friends and Austins a great place It makes me feel pretty special the way people feel about me there Its pretty cool Do you still feel like a celebrity when youre there I guess a little bit I dont really look at it that way I try to be involved in the community there and here as much as I can My wife and I do a lot for childrens hospitals Im a pretty laidback guy I stay out of the scene as much as possible Playing in the NFL were already in a glass box so the offseason is a time where I can relax and just spend some good family time and stay out of the spotlight Id imagine its hard to do that down there right Yeah anywhere you go you get recognized Thats nice What made you commit to the University of Texas Well I grew up in Texas I always kind of felt that if I ever had the chance to go play at UT that I was going to do that Late in my high school career I got the offer and loved Coach Mack Brown and it was a dream come true for me I really didnt have any doubts thats where I was supposed to be Its such a different city than the rest of Texas Yeah the perception of Texas is a little different and then you go to Austin and youre like Whoa I didnt know this was really Texas Its a great place Its pretty hill country lots of water You can pretty much find whatever you want there You finished in the Top3 Heisman vote two times in your college career Did you ever have any bitterness about missing out Maybe I thought I may win it the first year 2008 that I got invited The second year I wasnt all that concerned because we were playing in the National Championship and that really was my ultimate goal anyways Looking back I got no regrets It was cool to be honored Football is a team sport man its a team sport in college its a team sport in the NFL Guys play well around you and you play well then generally youre going to have some success It wasnt anything I did I was part of a good team What was it like then jumping right to Cleveland You went from big man on campus to backup in a totally new environment Probably the biggest challenge of my life was that transition from college to pro I think the thing that is probably the most challenging for me was for the first time in my life I had not been healthy I had major shoulder issues From that hit in the championship game against Alabama Yeah issues to where didnt know if I was going to get drafted I went from thinking I was going to get drafted pretty high to not even knowing Thats a pretty big emotional ride there Then I go to Cleveland and there was no lack of effort or how bad I wanted to be successful there It just didnt work out for a lot of different reasons I just took it on the chin and tried to bounce back and now Im in a place where I feel confident I feel comfortable and I know where Im supposed to be Right now I feel like Ive grown up a lot since I first came into this league from that standpoint How do you mean I feel like Ive learned a lot about how this game is played Ive had the ability to sit back these last couple of years and watch and learn a whole lot of things and evaluate and figure out if Im given this opportunity again how am I going to handle it Im in a much better position now mentally and physically to handle that So yeah its been quite the journey but I feel Im where Im supposed to be right now What did you take away from your time in Cleveland that you still use today I took away a lot Ill never forget some of the things that happened in Cleveland whether you want to use that as motivation or you want to use that as a chance to learn and evaluate what went on I think in a lot of different ways Ive grown to channel some of the things that went on there and use it in a positive way and again Im happy with where I am now and I always prepare to do my best and answer the call if needed Is that from a football perspective or a personal growth one I think both I think from a football standpoint and also just a life standpoint Really before I came into the league I hadnt faced a whole lot of adversity had to bounce back and pick myself up from failure and things not going the way you want it to I think Ive just grown up a lot in general I dont think theres any situation that will come that I wont be able to handle When you faced that adversity did you have someone to lean on Yeah Ive got people around me that I feel like always shoot me straight From a football perspective I just had to really dial in on my job and my responsibilities Im not a better athlete than everyone else anymore Ive got to learn how to play the position and all the things that come with that I dont think theres any place Id rather be than right where I am now because I feel confident in what we do as a unit as an offense I feel like I can run that show I was in five systems my first five years in the league where I didnt know the intricacies of things that were going on Thats a tough thing playing quarterback Here Ive had three years now not a whole lot of experience on the field some but Ive really had a chance to speak the same language for this long and feel pretty confident about that And thats what you wrote about in The Players Tribune last year Is writing something that interests you after football That was fun to do that I kind of go about my business as professional as I can and try to be the same person every day but at the same time when The Players Tribune approached me about that I felt like it wouldnt be a bad idea to let people who always ask me to let them know Heres what Im doing heres where Im at Just because of being a backup Yeah and I think at this point in my career I hope for an opportunity at some point But at the same time Im thankful for where Im at learning how to lead when Im not on the field and being around guys every day and trying to help us win games Thats a challenge in itself for me but I do feel like I bring that to the table and I mean if anything Ive learned you just never know in this league whats going to happen and the best thing you can do is always be prepared Thats kind of my approach every day Because you never played a snap last year in the regular season did you get antsy I think you do get a little bit antsy As the weeks go by and as the season goes by you get halfway through the season its been three months since youve really played real football I think at that point its even more of a mental approach to coach yourself up keep grinding keep doing the extra stuff that youve done Maybe grab some receivers at the end of practice if theyre not gassed and work on some timing but thats all part of this game you know So how much do you cherish these next two games then I certainly dont take it for granted I think what the preseason allows me to do is realize this game is fun You play with guys you may or may not be playing with during the season But also look at it as a chance to help those guys to make a name for themselves help those guys make some plays And again as I mentioned earlier this is the ultimate team sport It takes 11 guys every time I want to be able to do my job as good as I can each play and hope that Im doing enough that the guys around me are doing their jobs and we can go score some points I look forward to preseason With that being said how much stock can you put into these games especially if you have a tough outing one day Its tough man Every time you want to go out on the field you want to put your best foot forward You want to play well I think theres a lot of things I did well against Baltimore theres a lot of things I need to clean up I think just as a unit overall we all gotta clean up We just gotta be a little more efficient and learn from some of those things When you think about Kirk Cousins ahead of you and the unpredictability of his upcoming offseason does it give you any consternation I think from being in the NFL for the last seven years if theres ever been a time where I have just been locked in on one day at a time its now because you just never know Kirk has played great the last couple of years I think hes going to have another great year The offense by the time we get to the season I think were going to have a pretty solid identity of who we are and what were trying to do I know theres high expectations in the locker room so even though Im not on the field Im part of that and Im proud of that I gotta do my part that if something does happen I need to come in and play a couple of games we dont miss a beat Thats what I take pride in Every day Im doing what Im supposed to do to be ready for that moment There may be other ways to look at it but for me thats the way Im going to approach it I heard you and Kirk both went to the Coldplay concert a couple weeks ago too Yeah it was cool Nate Sudfeld went too It was weird to do that during training camp but it was fun Who sang the most out of the three of you Oh Kirk and Nate for sure I didnt know many Coldplay songs I was listening to them on the way there so I could get familiar with them but Kirk and Nate knew all the songs So you just leaned on them Yeah I just leaned on them And are you giving Kirk any fathering advice with their baby due soon Yeah hes getting close Yeah hes asked me a little bit Im sure most of those questions are going to come when the babys here Theres always so many things with your first child youre just like I dont know what Im supposed to do Im sure those conversations will heat up a lot once the baby comes',\n",
       " 104: 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On TE Jordan Reed LB Junior Galette and LB Ryan Anderson Theyre going to suit up in pregame and well see where they are Reed looks very good Junior had another good day today Anderson didnt do much On if anyone has been ruled out yet No On if he will hold starters out for the fourth preseason game and if he has determined how much they will play on Sunday Correct How much am I going to play them Sunday I dont know play them probably be a half at least At least a half Maybe end of the third quarter well see how we do On the value of having a regularly scheduled week Its been a good week good preview of how its going to be like in the regular season Youre right from preparation to days off to WednesdayThursdayFriday practice tomorrow well have a walk through at Andrews Joint Base Andrews and play Sunday So itll be good having an afternoon game on a Sunday Its good work for us against a good team On practicing at Joint Base Andrews tomorrow Its great man Its just a small token of our appreciation You know its great to do that Weve done that every year since Ive been here and they did it before I was here I guess So its great to get over there shake some hands show the respect that we definitely have for the military On who he hopes will dress for Sundays game You know what Im hoping that they all dress up and play but at the end of the day its up to the trainers and that player So I leave it up to them I try not to get my hopes up on a certain guy or a group of guys I just try to wait and see how theyre doing At the end of the day their health is the most important thing We all need the work coaches included on game day But we have to make sure theyre healthy also On if there is a possibility Galette andor Reed could play in the fourth preseason game No On if the value in playing Cincinnati is lessened given his familiarity with the team Its still the same You know Im familiar doesnt mean theyre familiar So we have to get them schooled up on what they do and some tendencies and try to attack them that way both offensively and defensively Trying to give them a picture of what to expect and see how they execute On if the receivers will have enough time to work with QB Kirk Cousins before Week 1 I hope so I think theres a lot of teams going through that with new receivers on new teams You know were going to utilize every second of the day we have outside and then inside the meeting rooms and Im sure theyll do some extra on their own time But I think being together as long as they have since OTAs and training camp got four preseason games in or three I think theyll be in good shape On if he scripts the first few plays of preseason games Yeah we give them a little first group of plays were going to expect to call early in the game so they get familiar with them And defense we will go over the calls and just get used to the calls and all that stuff at nightly meetings Offensive Coordinator Matt Cavanaugh On the difference in QB Kirk Cousins approach this year Even if he decides to grind a little less hes still grinding Hes got a nice schedule Hes got every minute accounted for Hes got a routine of how he studies an opponent everything starting from late Monday starting to look at tape looking at defensive scheme their personnel Tuesday getting a little more in depth whether hes doing it here or at home on his iPad and then obviously Wednesday we start installing a plan So hes still putting plenty of time in but I think he is a little more relaxed but hes never going to be satisfied and thats kind of what we want out of him Its a position that you cant ever think youve got it all figured out On how similar the preparation was this week to a regular season game Thats a great question We actually took this week as a mock regular season week so our preparation was pretty scheduled We simulated a typical Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then obviously tomorrow the last day before we play So it was kind of a dry run because of a couple of changes on the staff just for guys to get used to how we do it and that was a good reminder what the season is going to be like because it becomes a grind for us too I think we adapted really well We got a lot of work done we got the things installed on time that we needed to install And then a reminder that its the preseason is just you know its the third game of the preseason Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter On if anything stuck out to him about being in a new position on staff From a routine standpoint no because Ive been here for two years and we didnt change the routine much It was just assigning some responsibilities that were someone elses and now a new guys doing it and me included So my time was a little more busy being accountable for the whole plan but I dont think there was major changes to what were doing and how were doing it On questions hed still like to have answered about the offense Listen we as an organization and certainly as an offense expect to be productive every time we go on the field and we werent The first game we had two threeandouts and that was pretty much it Last week it took us a little while to get started and then we had a nice twominute drive and looked better but we have high expectations We want to be more efficient running the ball We want to be more solid in protections We want to be accurate throwing balls and guys getting open So thats a focus of ours every day we go out You can always say Well good thing its the preseason because we havent been sharp for a couple of quarters until the second quarter of the last game we kind of picked it up a little bit But we need to go out and start fast That builds confidence that were going to do things the right way and were going to have it expected all the time Theres still some time to fix things and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes On if this weeks preparation serves like a dress rehearsal for the regular season It does Its very much mirrored what our normal week is like Our meeting time was extended a little bit Qe were more detailed in the preparationWwe did segments so on Wednesday we put in our base first and seconddown plan with different personnel groups Thursday we did our third downs and then today we did our short yardage goal line and red zone and thats pretty much our routine for the week I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the routine is going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff On how deep into the playbook hes able to go in preparing players for preseason games Another great question Because its still the preseason particularly the first two games we really didnt narrow down a lot We kind of went in thinking everything weve practiced all through OTAs and training camp is still available to us Now that were game planning a team obviously that gets cut down so the number of plays wed carry in certain situations would be fewer with a lot more detail I think theyve felt like this week they had a chance to really zone in on what was going to be expected what plays to expect when to expect to them what their responsibilities were and that should help with execution On game plans being vanilla early in the preseason I dont know about know vanilla Quite honestly the first preseason game when you know your starters are only going to play half a dozen plays maybe 10 plays youre really more focused on the second and third groups and what can they handle Your starters come out they know the playbook so you kind of take some of that stuff away and then you get a little more vanilla if you will Last week we had a decent plan It wasnt a normal schedule but we put in a decent plan and it took us awhile to get rolling but we finally figured it out and then this week a lot more detail On Cousins growth with the uptempo offense He is probably a lot more prepared to do it now The more you are in an offense and the more you understand all the verbiage and nuances you run plays and you get different looks You might run the same play five times in a game and get a completely different look a different front a different pressure a different coverage and youre adjusting on the fly I think all that lends itself to him being more exposed to what might happen on a play So if we do something that is uptempo and the ball is snapped quickly his recognition should be a lot quicker and I think he is getting to that point We all as a group are going to put a game plan together we think will help us win the game whether its slowing the game down speeding it up throwing it every down running every down it really doesnt matter as long as we are all in agreement and we understand what our objectives are and what we have to do to win On the benefit of going uptempo Well the other thing it does is it makes the defense slow down a little bit too They have less time to react Youre going right to the line of scrimmage calling the play we are in a twominute mentality so we are going right to the line of scrimmage The quarterback is hand signaling he is calling out protections The defense has to get their call in they cant disguise coverages as well They dont want to get caught offguard Its hard from the sideline I think defensively to get a pressure on you know signaling pressure Some teams do it most dont So I think from that standpoint you kind of slow them down a little bit just by getting to the line of scrimmage real quick On the benefit of having the top four pass catchers on the field with Cousins on Sunday Well obviously they are all very talented guys so we want them out there We are also of the mindset that again this is not for real yet I mean we are playing a game and we want to play well and get a win but our opening game is almost two weeks away so we want to be ready for that We are not going to expose somebody in the preseason that we dont think is ready If they are ready to play and we get the OK from the medical people and the organization says lets play him well play him But I think most of those come down to gametime decisions They are all progressing well They have all been on the field for the most part the last few days and we are excited about that On C Chase Roullier Im not doing a lot of work with him but Bill Callahan is wearing him out Bill is putting in all the time necessary to get him prepared Now he has been here he is learning the offense He was getting a lot of work with the second group So he has just stepped up a notch He has been in with the ones I think his communication is getting much better He and Kirk are starting to feel each other out you know understanding Here is couple of my cadences that we have to master I want you to be real precise with your protection calls Remember I can always trump you and make a different call so listen what I am saying So those are things that he was getting to a real comfort level with Spencer Long and now he has got a younger guy in there who we have to feel him out too So from that standpoint it could happen at any position Any of the 11 positions somebody could go down and somebody else has to go in and we expect guys to come in and perform I am confident that Chase will do a fine job',\n",

       " 128: 'The Redskins running game hasnt quite found its groove thus far in the preseason but Sundays game against Cincinnati will provide the best dress rehearsal of the preseason Orchestrating a successful run game is like putting together a rock band Youve got to be in unison head coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday All six seven eight nine 10 guys have got to be in unison and we just havent been right when the ones are in thereYes its just preseason footballs version of the dress rehearsal but the Redskins running game has been off key Through two games starting running back Rob Kelley has carried the ball 13 times Hes gained 12 yards Rob Kelley hasnt gotten many good looks Gruden said simply Other guys came in there we got Samaje Perine some good looks and he had some good hits Grudens right Perine was indeed effective rushing for 45 yards on eight carries as the secondteamers took the field in the second half of preseason game No 2 against Green Bay However the first teamers havent gotten it going on the ground yet The cause for concern is understandable considering Washington ranked 21stin the NFL in rushing yards per game last season On top of that the Redskins could potentially be without starting center Spencer Long for the beginning of the regular season as he recovers from a minor knee injury But on the other hand the reason Gruden and his players are answering run game questions is because of 12 carries by Rob Kelley roughly just a halfs worth of work in a regular season game When the Redskins did run the ball in 2016 they did so effectively averaging 45 yards per carry the ninthbest mark in the NFL Im not really concerned no Gruden said in his press conference after the Green Bay game I know the guys we have up front and I know offensive line Coach Bill Callahan and I know the runners that we have so Im not concerned We do have to execute better We have to put them in better situations Maybe well look at the calls that were calling but for the most part Im not concerned really Gruden obviously wont be pushing the panic button in August but the importance of a successful run game was paramount to the Redskins in 2016 When they had success on the ground they ran the football more often When they ran the football more often they won more often Kelley made nine starts in 2016 for Washington When he had at least 15 carries the Redskins were 401 Less than 15 carries the Redskins were 04 For better or worse Kelley has the numbers attached to his name But the Redskins offensive line has plenty of talent as does the tight end group and they expect success too It takes all 11 players on the field at one time right tackle Morgan Moses said Its not one position weve got to come together and get it working Obviously in the second half against Green Bay the second group got the ball running a little bit So theres capability of doing that Weve just got to go out there and show it The Redskins next test comes against the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday A middleofthepack rushing defense in 2016 Cincinnati has an aggressive front seven that could cause issues if the Redskins dont execute Theyre just a physical sound football team running back Chris Thompson said We played them last year ended up in a tie We can look back at that game from last year and take some things that we did wrong some things that we did right and carry it into this game With the fourth preseason game most likely scheduled as a rest day for the starters Sunday against Cincinnati may be the last chance for Washington to find its running rhythm before taking the stage Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles You know Ive said this before when the run game doesnt work its not one guy Sometimes its tight end sometimes its a tackle sometimes its a back sometimes its the center Gruden said So weve just got to get everybody on the same page Weve just got to keep at it Its all about practice and working at it and getting better',\n",

For Victory is presented by Papa Johns Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win STAY IN RHYTHM The Redskins firstteam offensive unit got off to a slow start against both the Baltimore and Green Bay before finally scoring a touchdown on a long drive against the Packers last Saturday Getting the ball just before the twominute warning quarterback Kirk Cousins marched the offense 78 yards down the field on 10 plays capped by a fouryard touchdown reception from wide receiver Jamison Crowder on a 4 th andgoal play just before halftime I do think we got in a rhythm in that twominute which helps Cousins said Plays were working and sometimes that can feed the next play Weve been pretty good when we get in a nohuddle and just have an up tempo to our offense thats been good for us We didnt get behind the chains We were I think for the most part in secondandmedium or thirdandmedium We didnt put ourselves in a lot of tough situations of thirdand12 or thirdand15 I think it was good to have that drive but weve all acknowledged that so far this preseason we havent been good enough for what we want to do this regular season Were excited for the chance on Sunday to start trying to put our best foot forward and put a better product on the field Cousins and Co played the entire first half against the Packers and it could be the same case this Sunday against the Bengals as is normally the case for the third preseason game One way in which Washington could get into a better flow is through the hands of wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr In the first two preseason games Pryor has caught one pass for 11 yards on three targets This week the pair stayed out at practice 30 minutes after it was completed to work on their timing As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time TIME TO STEP UP ROOKIE With Spencer Long currently sidelined after undergoing a minor procedure on his knee this week the Redskins will ask rookie sixthround pick Chase Roullier to take over the reins at center It is certainly a step up for Roullier as hes transitioned from a lateround pick at a small school to starting in the NFL in the matter of a few months But hes ready for the challenge It worked pretty well Roullier said of his work with the firstteam offensive unit Just continuing to learn the offense the best I can so that I am able to be more comfortable with my calls that Im making out there Its definitely something I need to continue to work on Ive had some errors in the last couple of games and its something Ive been focusing on practice Roullier also benefits from having a veteran offensive line around him along with Pro Bowl quarterback Kirk Cousins who said Roullier is very intelligent Hell be tasked with guiding an offensive line against one of the leagues more aggressive defenses He can pass protect I think thats a strength of his his ability to hold up in pass protection Cousins said Theres going to be growing pains Thats understandable but its exciting to see potential when its there and its certainly there with Chase Hes a good teammate a class act so Im excited to work with him Were going to throw him in the fire against the Bengals and see what he can do Im going to do all I can do to help him making protection calls and trying to be decisive so he doesnt have to think too much But Im excited to get him out there and see what hes got SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE RETURNING PLAYERS The Redskins could be at near fullstrength on Sunday as tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Junior Galette returned to practice this week while wide receiver Josh Doctson increased his activity For Galette it could mark his first game in a Redskins uniform since first signing with the Redskins in 2015 The 2015 and 2016 campaigns resulted in seasonlong Injured Reserve stints due to torn Achilles while he was sidelined against the Ravens and Packers with a hamstring injury Gruden said on Thursday that hell be a gametime decision against the Bengals Its been two years so now its getting to the point where its like a movie thats supposed to be released and keeps getting postponed Galette said with a smile And youre like Man Then weve got Jay Gruden here talking about Youre just a tease You know hes kidding around but at the same time youre like I want to go out there and prove that I am everything they expect me to be As for Reed he was activated off the ActivePhysically Unable to Perform list after spending all of training camp on the sideline with a toe injury He was a full participant in practices this week His presence on the field alone significantly alters the landscape of the offense particularly one that is looking to end the preseason on a high note Jordan has unique movement skills and then because hes often lined up in a way where hes being covered by safeties and linebackers and nickel corners he creates matchup issues said Cousins If you want to put your best corner on Jordan Reed thats one option but then now youre opening a door for whoever else is out there a Josh Doctson a Terrelle Pryor a Vernon Davis so on and so forth SHOW EM WHAT YOU CAN DO MASE For the second week in a row the Redskins will have Mason Foster guiding the defensive unit as the Mike linebacker with Zach Brown serving as the Moe linebacker Last week the pair started together and totaled a combined five tackles I think he is just a physical cat in there said Redskins defensive coordinator Greg Manusky From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit Manusky added that perhaps the biggest asset of having Foster and Brown together is their ability to cover the entire field Thats why I like both of them right now Manusky said Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the

       " 257: 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On encouraging TE Jordan Reed in a oneonone drill against S DJ Swearinger Its a very competitive period down there oneonones receivers vs Dbacks And its a great route You know the whole thing about it is defensive backs have got to make it a perfect throw and a great catch Fortunately it was a great throw and a great catch for Jordan and Kirk DJ was right there had great coverage But yeah its great to have him back On the health of Reed and LB Junior Galette Jordan looks fine He looks good You know I still want to see how hes doing tomorrow and then obviously Saturday and Sunday see how he does in pregame warmup but he looks very good Very crisp very fast very sudden like he always is which is good Junior hes been doing more and more each day and I think thatll be a gametime decision On LB Ryan Anderson Same thing Same thing He did a little less today but were going to keep getting him checked out and were not going to push the issue unless he has full strength full range of motion and full strength Right now he doesnt have full strength Hes close though very close On if C Chase Roullier is preparing to start at center in Week 1 Were preparing Chase like he needs to go You know I think getting Spencer Long back were hopeful even if it could be in a backup role if hes not 100 percent ready So theres a good chance there also So we have a couple different options But the big thing is to get Chase ready to go and take advantage of the reps hes getting And hes done that hes done a nice job We just brought another center in here for depth you know we need for Sundays game and for the game against Tampa Well take a good look at Lucas Crowley and see how he does On the inside linebackers and the status of that position group Where do we stand Right now were starting with Mason Foster and Zach Brown You know thats a starting point And then obviously Martrell Spaight and Will Compton will get plenty of reps and then youve got Nico Marley and Zach Vigil and then obviously Josh HarveyClemons So we have a good stable there We kind of moved Pete Robertson to outside backer when all our outside backers got injured So hes getting some reps as a pass rusher and hes doing a good job On what he likes about Mason Foster at Mike linebacker I think you know Mason played well last year He really did And hes a smart player and hes very physical So we like his physicality Hes healthy and hes playing well On the nickel corners I think right now Kendall Fuller is probably our nickel corner if we had to start today Joshua Holseys doing an excellent job though you know For a rookie a seventhround pick hes surpassed expectations by far Hes done a good job both outside and inside So those two guys are really the ones were counting on On his level of concern potentially starting a rookie at center Yeah seems like weve had a little rollercoaster ride at center since Ive been here Kory Lichtensteiger was here and then he got hurt We had to try Josh LeRibeus and last year we had some issues early on so I think we just have to get Chase Roullier ready We drafted him for a reason Hes a true center from Wyoming and did a good job last year at Wyoming but he is a rookie But hes a very smart guy and hes learned a lot Coach Bill Callahan has done an excellent job with him If he has to play I think hell be ready He has a couple major obstacles at Philadelphia Fletcher Cox and Tim Jernigan there inside and they have some good pass rushers so itll be a great test for him You dont ever like to thrust a guy into the fire but we think hes a mature guy and if he has to play hell play If Spencer Long is ready to go itll be great but Chase is mature and I think he can handle it On the rotation at center during the past few seasons Its difficult because the centers the one who makes all the calls presnap Hes the one that communicates and youve got to have a smart center You want an athletic center you want a big center At the end of the day youve got to have a center that number one theyve got to get the snaps back and theyve got to be able to communicate Then theyve got to be able to finish blocks and be able to get up on the next level and pass protect and all that good stuff Theres a lot on a centers plate especially for a rookie But like I said Chase can handle it Weve had to mix and match different centers since Ive been here but we just have to deal with it On if he has adjusted the reps for firstteam offense in practice Oh yeah were trying to get as many reps as we can without wearing them down Yesterday we had about a 17play drive to end practice which was good to get them out there and stay on the field and were trying to get more and more together Very important like you say once you get everybody back Still its important for Kirk Cousins to get as many looks as he can get so well try to do the best we can without wearing them out but get them a lot of reps On how important QB Kirk Cousins ability to help Roullier at center is A lot a lot I think earlier in Kirks career it might have been a little bit more of an issue but I think now this stage Kirk feels a lot more comfortable with the protection calls and hell help out a lot The big thing is initially getting the calls right and I think Chase has done a good job so far out here Its going to be a great test for the Bengals Defensive Coordinator Paul Guenther and the Bengals they give you a lot of different looks double As they give you the odd looks they give you spinner looks threedown fronts fourdown fronts all of them So it will be a great test for us Defensive Coordinator Greg Manusky On the combination of Mason Foster and Zach Brown at inside linebacker I mean were going back and forth all the time during practice with Mason and with Comp Will Compton and then with Zach and even Martrell Spaight We are going through a process thats the preseason right now Thats why I like both of them right now Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the preseason On what Foster brings to the Mike linebacker position I think he is just a physical cat in there From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit On if he can make sense of Defensive Line Coach Jim Tomsulas rotation along the defensive line No Ive known Jimmy for a long time and I just let him do whatever he wants to do pretty much From our aspect we want to see players play at different positions because during the season you never know you might need a backup nose that has played end and vice versa So switching those guys inside and out has been a good scenario because they have got to learn left defensive end they have got to learn right defensive end they have got to learn a little bit of nose as well We are just tinkering with it figuring out what is going to happen Here in the next couple weeks we will figure it out On when he changes from evaluating the whole roster to focusing on preparing the starters I think in this third preseason game I think thats kind of the avenue that we are sticking with but across the board you never know Some guys get injured or sometimes other guys do show up from a previous game they didnt play as good You know every game is different for every player because sometimes they have had great performances and other times they just didnt just for some reason We are honing in on it of course with the players that we have got going into this third preseason game Rotationally wise Jimmy up front I dont know maybe the second series is totally different We do have a plan in place and we kind of know where we are going to try and alter it On the value of having a nose tackle that can play in the nickel package as well I think that is a big plus That is what we are trying find out I am just saying that sometimes during the preseason games at the end of the game we want to see them against a little bit better competition too So switching those guys is a point that we are trying to figure out On his philosophy on where CB Josh Norman will lineup in his defensive system I think certain corners are sometimes really relaxed on the right side and some are on the left and sometimes if you flip them at times it actually messes with their head It depends on the individual If he feels comfortable switching sides then that is fine All of a sudden if he feels like we have a threat on the outside that we have to have Josh cover then we will flip them It depends on the personnel and it also depends on the player that you have On what makes CB Kendall Fuller a good fit at nickel corner He is smart I think from a smart player inside that has good quickness and capabilities of reading the route combinations And that guy sometimes if you move that corner into that nickel spot it is a lot of space its a lot of room and sometimes they dont have a great feel for it Kendall has been doing a great job We will be cross training of course Joshua Holsey has been doing it and we will be training some other corners inside as well On how Normans skill set fits into the defensive system It is the things that you cant coach I think from that standpoint he is just a savvy player that has a feel for the game I think even when you draft players coming out of college there is just certain guys that just have a feel for the game Its just uncanny Even Jonathan Allen has a feel for the game and you cant say anything but that these guys have a feel for the game That is what Josh has From defensive calls stick him in a one always covering that same guy over and over and over I am going to try to use his talents a little bit better try to get him in quarters a little bit and get him in different coverages that we have So we will get him to play the ball a little bit more On how important it is to see LB Junior Galette in game action before the regular season I think it is huge We have got to see him that way because he hasnt started he hasnt played in two years or whatever it has been During practice he has been doing a great job He is confident in his abilities His abilities are very good right now I think right now learning the defense he has done a great job but he has been banged up I want to see him against good personnel and see what he can do So it is majorly important that he plays in these preseason games On how his relationship with players has changed since transitioning from a position coach to a coordinator I dont think it has been any different They knew who I was and I talked to all the defensive players when I was here last year as an outside linebacker coach I think the biggest thing is the acquisition of the coaches that we have brought in With Jimmy and Torrian Gray and James Rowe and then with Chad Grimm and then Kirk Olivadotti all those guys its a tight group of coaches that are very specific I always tell the coaches this when I was a position coach I just facilitate the information from the guy that wants it to the players I cant sit in the room with 30 some guys and say OK this is what the corner is doing It is going to waste too much time They do a great job of facilitating the information that I am trying to get to those players and we are having success with it On how quickly S DJ Swearinger was able to integrate himself into the team I think it was the first week Just like the physical gifts and talents that players have some guys just have that aura about them and that is what he has He has that power I love the energy that he brings to the table and across the board he is trying to get it right I dont know exactly how many years he has been in the league but he has been doing a couple jumps back a forth from different teams He wants to see what he can do and see this defense where it is going to go and it is going to a high place I think On his perception of Normans play last year and if it has changed You know last year he played fine Sometimes it is just situational stuff Splits the receivers which Torrian Gray does a great job of talking about with the players across the board just honing their skills into the level of just breaking it down from a football knowledge I think that is what Torrian is doing with him and actually DJ helping him as well Everybody is helping each other on the back end From a calls perspective theyre doing a great job and we are playing together I dont care what call it is as long as we are all on the same page we will have success',\n",

       " 292: 'The quarterback and wide receiver duo has been working together throughout the offseason but after two preseason games they still need to enhance their rapport The pursuit to get better has been the driving force behind the last year for Terrelle Pryor Sr switching positions to wide receiver and looking to take the next step in his career on a new team with a quarterback hes still adjusting to Thats been made clear throughout most of this offseason and training camp as both have made continual efforts to improve their games by learning from each others perspective and taking time for more reps after practice Wednesday offered another good example During drills Pryor caught a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins and while the connection looked clean something felt a little off for the wide receiver As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time The postpractice activity lasted for about 30 minutes and its the kind of work that Pryor believes should be endemic to the way professionals train If you know that something isnt right and then you dont fix it you really arent pros and you really dont take this job seriously That mindset is what has propelled Pryor this offseason evidenced in his countless workout videos he posted over the summer and its also what fuels Cousins who has needed to adjust to a new batch of receivers Particularly the workouts have been about timing accounting for different types of coverages and adjusting accordingly For example Pryor said he knows that when cornerbacks will throw press and bump coverage Cousins will take a hitch in his dropback knowing it will take Pryor a little longer to find separation from his defender This kind of work makes sense especially considering that Pryors only caught one pass on three targets in two preseason games Their preparation for those games was limited in terms of studying their opponents and Pryor was surprised by some of the coverages the Ravens threw at them in just a couple of series When we came out against the Ravensthey had safeties rolling over top doubleteaming me they had the safety double teaming me and nobody on top of the other guy Pryor said I didnt expect that in the preseason so little things like that happen that you werent expecting This is the rationale for not panicking about the firstteam offenses sluggish starts Pryor pointed to the Giants whose own offense has struggled even as it is expected to do big things this season too Pryor thinks there should be some bigger improvements against the Bengals this Sunday When you start gameplanning this is where were going were going to TP on this play were going to Jamison Crowder were going to Jordan Reed on this play this is the matchup were looking forward Pryor said We get in the game its there now its up to us to win it catch the ball and make the play Right now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday Cousins has appreciated Pryors approach and its rubbed off on his own work ethic I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year In other words theres nothing special happening here except in the desire to keep grinding and getting better than before to hit the ground running in sync and ready for the Eagles You just want to go back over it and make sure weve got it down Pryor said So when we get into the Week 1 and get into game time serious time its all clicking we can just go',\n",

       " 731: 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 The Redskins get the ground game back on track through some powerful running from Fat Rob In Washingtons first two preseason outings the combination of Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson struggled to generate a balanced offensive attack Against the Baltimore Ravens and Green Bay Packers the pair combined for just 21 rushing yards Those woes continued through the first quarter of Sundays nationally televised matchup with the Bengals as Kelley ran the ball just one time for four yards as the Redskins did not pick up a first down on the opening frame But in the second quarter Kelley finally got it going first with a fiveyard run and then a 21yard gain in which the Tulane product sliced the middle of an overly aggressive Cincinnati defense Kelley capped the drive with a oneyard touchdown run on 2 nd andgoal his first score of the preseason I think the difference for me was the offensive line Kelley admitted after the game They opened up some holes Obviously you can see they had some holes that anybody could run through out there I think just getting back to what got me to starting running back today Just some hard runs pushing the pile and stuff like that So we have to get back to the basics Kelley would finish the afternoon with 10 carries for 57 yards while Thompson chipped in with nine yards as well I think we were able to do a couple different things Gruden said We tried some gap pulls and some gap runs We did some outside zone some inside zones and for the most part I guess we executed well 2 For the first time as a member of the Redskins Junior Galette saw game action Galette joked in the days leading up to Sundays game with the Bengals that his return to the field was like a highly anticipated movie that kept getting delayed Originally signed by the Redskins during 2015 training camp Galette twice suffered torn Achilles that wiped away his last two years Then after an impressive early training camp showing this year Galette was held out of Washingtons first two preseason games with a hamstring injury But on Sunday Galette appeared on 21 defensive snaps and recorded two tackles It felt amazing man Galette said Coming in here going through the process getting on the bus from the hotel the pregame meal everything felt amazing like I never left Its been two years Just enjoying the camaraderie everything the pregame music on my headphones going out there warming up it felt great Galettes best trait as a football player is his speed rush On his very first play he nearly recorded a sack when the Stillman College product got a perfect jump off the line and ducked inside of the Bengals left tackle to apply pressure to Andy Dalton Dalton got the ball off on a quick threestep drop but Galette was just inches away from taking down the quarterback Ive been doing everything I did in the game in practice so it just felt great you know to just go do it in live action Galette said 3 Kirk Cousins was disappointed in his picksix but remains optimistic about whats ahead for the passing attack during the regular season In his final preseason action before the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Cousins completed 10of19 passes for 109 yards along with an eightyard carry on a third down quarterback keeper As was the case in his first two preseason showings Cousins struggled to get the offense moving in the first quarter In the first 15 minutes the Pro Bowler completed just 2of5 attempts for 11 yards while taking two third down sacks and being called for intentional grounding on another third down play Opening up the second quarter Washingtons offense appeared poised to final break through as the Redskins broke into Cincinnati territory in just four plays But on a 3 rd and5 attempt in which Cousins tried to locate Thompson coming out of the backfield Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict jumped the running backs route and sprinted down the sidelined for a 62yard interception return for touchdown The interception was entirely my fault Cousins said He made a very good play but I gave him the opportunity to do that by being a little late to get there And then it was a good response to put that drive together We ran the ball so well with some really good play calls All those plays run together for me right now so you probably know better than me how we got down there But it was important to bounce back certainly Washington responded well though to the interceptions as Cousins led a 10play 75yard touchdown drive in which he completed three different passes of at least 12 yards locating Vernon Davis Terrelle Pryor Sr and Jamison Crowder for the gains With tight end Jordan Reed back on the field Washingtons offense particularly the passing game is at nearstrength entering the regular season We do have high expectations for a lot of different reasons Cousins said of the passing game For one we do protect well we have a very solid offensive line thats where it starts You have to have time to throw We do feel we have several players not just at the receiver position but the tight end position and the running back position who can help us in the pass game and its never going to be the same guy week in and week out its probably going to evolve each weekwho gets involved and who makes the biggest difference But we have high expectations and you have to be ready to go 4 Jordan Reed returns from the PUP List to record two catches for 12 yards After spending the entirety of training camp rehabbing a toe injury Washingtons Pro Bowl tight end was activated off the Physically Unable to Perform list on Aug 20 He was a full participant in last weeks practices and showed little rust in his return to the field catching two passes for 12 yards both on first down attempts on 18 plays Its great Crowder said of Reeds return I think that now that everyone is back for the offense that we are able to go forward and practice get that camaraderie back within the unit and hopefully be ready and productive We have Philadelphia coming Reeds presence changed the way Cincinnati approached Washingtons offense as the tight end was doubled on more than one occasion I did feel the defense was aware of him Cousins said He is a presence has a big effect on every game plan so we have to continue getting him out there and working together and get ready for Week 1 5 With a chip on their shoulder the secondteam defensive unit slowed Cincinnatis backups After the starters played all of the first half inside linebacker Martrell Spaight and the second defensive unit took over in the third quarter In the second half Cincinnati managed just three points Their final five drives ended with two punts two turnover on downs and an interception I felt like we did a great job said Spaight who finished with a gamehigh seven tackles We got a few stops out there the turnovers the sudden change we did a good job and Im thankful for that Late in the game Cincinnati appeared ready to potentially take back the lead as they drove all the way down to Washingtons 12yard line with less than nine minutes remaining But a 3 rd and5 attempt by McCarron the quarterback misplaced a ball that would find the hands of rookie safety Fish Smithson who returned the ball 63 yards into Washington territory I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they was going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play',\n",
       " 788: 'The Redskins got some big plays from rookies Joshua Holsey and Fish Smithson in the second half of their preseason victory over the Bengals Sunday night Most of the focus during the Redskins third preseason game Sunday evening at FedExField centered on the starters This was the dress rehearsal game after all the last time the firstteam offense would get a chance to play together before the regular season opener in a couple of weeks But there was still a game to be played in the second half where some young defensive backs stepped in to make some big plays including a defensive stand in the red zone with the clock winding down that helped the Redskins defeat the Bengals 2317 to collect the teams first victory of the preseason A tally in the preseason win column may not seem like a huge deal in the broad scheme of things except that every player battling for a roster spot knows their performance will be under constant scrutiny Making plays is at once important for the team and as an individual achievement to take pride in Or as undrafted safety Fish Smithson reasoned Some people dont watch the preseason they say it dont matter but at the end of the day inside out it matters after the way we won and the players that were out there wanted to make a stand We didnt want to give in we make plays and let people know we belong on the field Smithson had one of the highlights of the day a fourthquarter interception off quarterback AJ McCarron in front of the end zone that he nearly returned for a touchdown tripping up after 63 yards After a mostly quiet first two games this was the moment Smithson knew he was capable of taking I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they were going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play I thought he was going to go all the way to house with it cornerback Joshua Holsey said But thats good for us these young guys especially for him because hes had a really good training camp preseason as well Holsey made his big plays too His moment came in the third quarter after he had already made a good play in coverage to force an incompletion on third down Sent on a nickel blitz he is the teams other nickel corner behind Kendall Fuller Holsey saw the left tackle occupy an outside linebacker and had a clear path once running Jarveon Williams stepped up to block another blitzer in inside linebacker Will Compton Holsey used his speed to run down McCarron and got the first sack of his NFL career Once I seen the tackle go high and the back disappear I just hit another gear Holsey said Had to make sure I secured the sack it was all fun from there Holsey who played 25 snaps Sunday knew hed get a decent amount of opportunities once Fuller sat out One of the nice surprises at camp the seventhround pick knows that the cornerback room is pretty full but Sundays game was another positive impression for coaches You get that gametime experience good close games youve got to be able to make plays Holsey said These games right here give the coaches a good key of who they can trust in big situations they gotta be able to trust you out there on that field When I go out there I just try to make sure I do my assignment and fly around to the ball Thats what they want to see they just gotta make plays Right not its just me trying to just show them what I can do because its a great DB room right now Just trying to help my role with that group of guys He remained on the field during the final red zone stand where veteran safety Will Blackmon made a couple of big plays in the backfield before defensive back Jeremiah McKinnon broke up a pass in the back of the end zone on fourth down You dont want to be the guy that gives up that play Holsey said We were all talking the whole drive like we gotta make a play we gotta make a play lets get this started lets get off the field so its just a big momentum rush for us to get out there and make a play get a stop for the team and get us that first W of the preseason Between Holsey and Smithson their biggest test will come this Thursday in the teams final preseason game at Tampa Bay After Sundays performances they will carry some confidence into the short week hoping to channel that momentum into another big night Its big Sometimes you can go through games and not be able to make plays because at the end of the day the only thing you got is the film Smithson said So its kind of good to show people what you can do At the end of the day I made a good play but now Im moving on to Tampa And as for those Fish puns saturating social media Smithson is happy to see them Oh man I can just imagine he said My phones been blowing up I havent looked at it yet but Im ready for it',\n",

       " 937: 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On injuries The only injury that Ill go over is Phil Taylor Hes going to have surgery tomorrow He tore his left quad tendon He will be out for the year On the depth at nose tackle with DL AJ Francis and Joey Mbu Yeah Ziggy Hood can play there Stacy McGee can play there some too Those guys have played well Its been a constant battle throughout OTAs and training camp so those guys have gotten a lot of work Coach Jim Tomsulas rotated them in there different people with different groups part of the plan I feel terrible for Phil Taylor Sr because he did a great job at getting himself ready to play Hes in excellent shape but its just an unfortunate injury The rest of the guys have got to step up On his impressions of the firstteam offense from last Sunday Theres obviously a lot of coaching that we have to do clean up some things but overall I like the way we bounced back and stayed in the game Quite frankly thats the way a lot of our games are going to be in 2017 Theyre going to be close theres going to be some adversity and were going to have to overcome it and make some plays to keep us in games and then win them late There were some good things that we liked and obviously a lot of things that we need to clean up as is the case every week in pro football On what he hopes to see from the second and thirdstring players on Thursday Im hoping they play well Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust On if he would be more comfortable shifting DL Ziggy Hood and Stacy McGee to nose tackle as compared to more traditional nose tackles like Mbu and Francis Well see well see A lot is going to determine that how many defensive linemen are we going to dress on game day thats one if we dress five or six on game day how many were going to keep on the 53man roster Theres still some time for us to have those discussions and we will On if he feels more confident potentially starting Chase Roullier at center in Week 1 Yeah if I had to start him Id better feel OK because hes starting but he did some good things He mistargeted a couple plays which is natural a lot of movement Cincinnati had on certain down and distances But for the most part he did well He competed well and he stood his ground I felt him getting up to the next level a few times and he blocked some good defensive lineman over there so I was impressed with his first outing Weve just got to clean up some of his communication but overall I think he did well On if QB Nate Sudfeld will play the entire game Thursday Thats the intent yes On if Thursday is a chance for Sudfeld to prove he is worthy of a roster spot The thing about Nate is that Colt McCoy and Kirk Cousins are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back On his level of concern with WR Josh Doctson s injuries Well its been an issue Weve only had him a year a little bit over a year now and he hasnt really done a lot with us unfortunately but I think hes going to overcome these I think he could have played last week he could play Thursday if we wanted him to I think hes going to be ready to go for Philadelphia and now its a matter of keeping him out there and knock on wood we hope we can do that On if he views Doctson as a starting receiver Well we have some players there that have been performing in practice in his absence that have done well obviously Jamison Crowder and depends how many receivers you play If you play a tworeceiver set right now Crowder could be the starting Z it could be Josh it could be Ryan Grant We have plenty of options there The big thing is we want to keep them fresh If Terrelle Pryor Sr gets tired I wont hesitate at putting Josh at X or Ryan Grant at X or whatever so we have a good group of wideouts that could play anywhere at any time On if Doctson is having any trouble with confidence in his own health I dont know youd have to ask him that I think he just had some unfortunate he was running a lot in OTAs and training camp and he was doing some really good things It wasnt like he pulled it it was just tight I guess so to speak It hasnt been a major pull so I think hes going to be okay On if there is concern about LB Ryan Anderson being ready for the start of the season Well see I think if youve missed this much time theres some concern because he needs the practice Its not like we can just throw him out there Hey Hes a rookie he needs a lot of work the communication where hes supposed to be and how to get there So there is a little level of concern there but we feel like hell be ready eventually we just dont know when Its a unique injury Weve just got to get his strength back On if Roullier will play on Thursday Thats a good question You know we will wait and see come Thursday afternoon We will go through pregame warmup and see where we stand We will try to get Chase maybe a series or two and see how it goes but Ronald Patrick will get the majority We will go from there On if there is temptation to play players who might have starting roles who havent had a lot of reps Junior Galette is definitely not going to play He played with his injury very similar to Josh Doctson but he is not going to play Thursday Josh wants to play Thursday but that will be my decision here in about 24 hours On LB Will Compton RB Rob Kelley and CB Kendall Fuller Will Compton no he just has a chest contusion a little bit Kelley and Fuller Theyre OK they just took the day off a little sore On if he likes the new cutdown rules I do I do I do because I mentioned this before I just think that we have had these guys for so long that this is a great opportunity for a lot of them to play and show what they have not just for our team and our practice squad but for everybody else If you make a mad cut after the Thursday game or after our game against Cincinnati youre not going to be able to really pick anybody up You dont have the roster spots and then you dont have enough guys to play against Tampa because youre going to rest all your starters So it is great to have all these guys available and its great to see them play You give them an opportunity to see what they have in a pro stadium and a big game On his memories of last years game against Tampa Bay which was moved a day earlier because of Tropical Depression Nine That was a grind It was tough a tough week But we got through it and guys adjusted well They actually played well Mack Brown had a big game and did some good things We were able to look at a lot of good players On if he had previously played or coached in circumstances like that In a hurricane No That would be the first On if the team could look to add defensive linemen after roster cuts Yeah could be I think our scouts upstairs are looking at everybodys roster and projected cuts and seeing if there is somebody we could pick up that can help our football team well look at them Also for practice squad purposes But we feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Ive said that from day one I think with Joey Mbu and AJ Francis theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth But obviously if somebody they feel like is better well take a look On if he expects there to be a lot of fluctuation on the roster once all teams have cut from 90 to 53 Could be You know I dont anticipate a whole lot but you dont know Weve got to wait and see whos out there Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have On CB Joshua Holsey Ive been impressed with Josh Hes played nickel hes played corner Hes active Hes a good tackler Hes not the biggest guy in the world but he makes up for it with his smarts He knows where to go and where to be and has great coverage skills in my opinion I like his toughness I like his attitude and hes done well both inside and outside On which offensive coaches help in the booth Coach Matt Cavanaugh is up there He does good And then we have Kevin OConnell downstairs and obviously Wes Phillips downstairs and Coach Bill Callahan downstairs On if calling plays detracts from his time with the defense No I didnt spend a lot of time with them last year Every once in a while Id just pat them on the head and say good job or yell at them if they werent hustling I stay out of the schematics part of it Theyve already got all that stuff and the defensive coaches do an excellent job so well just let them do their job On areas in which RB Chris Thompson has improved this offseason Oh wow I think last year he was very good in his role I think we can expand his role if we want to Its just hes so good at the thirddown role that I just want to keep him there Hes a very valuable commodity to our football team both in pass protection and getting out on the routes I mean the thought of him not being around scares the heck out of me So hes improved every part of his game and a lot of these young players they do that You either get better or worse and hes just one of those guys that continues to work and hes gotten better at everything His vision on the running game and his pass protection has gotten better and better and his routes really are the most improved I think coming out of the backfield It takes some time for those guys to work their releases and work on the linebackers and run them at the right depth and come out at the right angles and all that stuff and hes darnnear perfected it',\n",

RedskinsBuccaneers Ingredients For Victory is presented by Papa Johns Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win TIME FOR THE SUDFELD SHOW The plan for Thursdays preseason finale against the Buccaneers as was the case last year is to have Nate Sudfeld start and play the entire game at quarterback Since being selected in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft last year Sudfeld has been Washingtons No 3 quarterback behind Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy His reps are few and far between as the third string quarterback so Thursday will show just how much hes progressed in the past year The thing about Nate is that Colt and Kirk are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back So far this preseason Sudfeld has completed 11of23 passes for 132 yards along with five rushing yards Last year the Indiana product capped off his first preseason completing eight passes for 72 yards and a touchdown in a driving rainstorm at Raymond James Stadium ENCORE PERFORMANCE FOR MACK In that rainy weather last year Washington was able to show the depth of the running back position with Mack Brown 149 and Rob Kelley 99 rushing for a combined 248 yards It was the conclusion of a training camp battle that would see Kelley edge out Brown for a spot on the Redskins first 53man roster But Brown would reemerge after spending the first half of the year on the practice squad In a Week 16 victory over the Chicago Bears Brown rushed for a gamehigh 82 yards 61 of which came on a fourth quarter touchdown run With Kelley Chris Thompson and rookie Samaje Perine expected locks on the active roster this year Browns performance against the Buccaneers on Thursday could go a long way into Washingtons brass needing to keep four running backs up During the offseason Brown cut down on his body fat while honing in on improved agility and speed through the help of players like LeSean McCoy and Tevin Coleman His hope is that itll result in a stronger 2017 campaign You watch Thompson every day and see that he is quick but then you see McCoy and I have never seen feet like that in person before Brown said He would just tell me think about Kobe Bryant Kobe worked on his shot every day his dribble every day post moves so why not work on your cuts every day He was right I lift and run but I dont do footwork every day He said he works on his balance and footwork every day so he can come out his cuts better So ever since then I have been working on coming out my cuts and balance drills THE SEARCH FOR THE RIGHT COMBINATION COMES TO A CLOSE While training camp and the preseason can tell a story for how reps will be delved out during the regular season for most position groups that isnt the case for the defensive linemen Under new defensive line coach Jim Tomsula the Redskins have tried just about every combination possible with the linemen on the 90man roster Washington of course lost Phil Taylor Sr for the season with a torn quad tendon The veteran was atop the depth chart at the nose tackle position So how players like Joey Mbu and AJ Francis perform against the Buccaneers could help in final decisions for which defensive linemen to keep on the 53man roster We feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Gruden said Ive said that from day one I think with Joey and AJ theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth ONE LAST IMPRESSION Less than 48 hours after the opening kickoff goes into the air at Raymond James Stadium Washington will have to slice down the roster from 90 players to 53 There will certainly be difficult decisions for the front office as is the case every year and there will be nerves for the players on the bubble But Grudens hope is that everyone who dresses the starters likely wont have their best performance yet Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Gruden said Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust For the pro scouts theyll have a busy weekend ahead but Gruden is confident the staff is prepared to assemble the best 53man roster Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them Gruden said But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have',\n",

together a solid final preseason showing With Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy taking the majority of practice and preseason reps over the last few months Sudfeld finally got his chance to see extended action on the field for the Redskins and he did not disappoint Exactly one year after his last start Sudfeld completed 22of33 passes for 278 yards along with two carries for four yards in a 1310 victory over the Buccaneers I thought it was a pretty solid night pretty efficient for the most part in terms of moving the ball Sudfeld said But disappointed that we werent able to get more points for whatever reason we were kind of getting bogged down at the end of drives but we were moving the ball which is good But again we need to finish So it was a solid night overall but a lot to improve on Not only was Sudfeld able to get the Redskins moving the secondyear Indiana product completed passes to 11 different players four of which recorded at least 30 receiving yards It was important for Sudfeld to have a good final outing with the roster being sized down to 53 players on Saturday afternoon With Sudfeld serving as the No 3 quarterback last year he was inactive for all 16 games So he understands that he doesnt have a ton of job security Theyre never easy Sudfeld said of roster cut deadlines You know whether you make the squad or not like last year I made the squad and so many of my good buddies didnt so its tough regardless So Im going to be there probably hanging out with some of my buddies my brother will be in town so well hang out and maybe go golfing or something probably try to get my mind off it but Ill see what happens 2 Mack Brown confident he made an impression With the Redskins top three running backs consider locks for the 53man roster Brown was one of many players on Thursday night putting the finishing touches on what they hope is enough positive tape to get active status In total Brown carried the ball 18 times for a gamehigh 69 yards One game doesnt determine my fate Brown said Ive been going hard ever since Day 1 at camp Whatever happens happens Ill leave my hand in Gods hands Im encouraged Im not discouraged Im thankful Brown was a numbers game cut last year for the first 53man roster but the University of Florida product eventually got his number called again in Week 8 last year While he was just a special teams contributor for most of the season he did record a 61yard touchdown against the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 victory Even if it isnt in Washington Brown believes hell be on an NFL roster once again this season I will be playing football somewhere this year Brown said I know that for a fact because God told me last night So whatever happens happens Like I said before I will always be a Redskin no matter what gives Not having a college career being fourthstring in my senior year they gave me a chance that nobody else did so Im thankful and Ill always love the Redskins I feel like the Redskins will win the Super Bowl this year 3 In a crowded wide receivers room Matt Hazel saved his biggest game for last Just as is the case at so many other positions for the Redskins this year the wide receivers group is loaded with talent Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder are all expected to get their targets and Ryan Grant remains someone the coaching staff is high on Beyond those four though the Redskins have eight other players on the 90man roster trying to make the active squad Among them is Matt Hazel a player who spent the majority of last season on the practice squad During Thursday nights game Hazel was the most productive wide receiver for both teams catching all four of his targets for a gamehigh 60 yards I felt like I was so locked in Hazel said I didnt really keep count Nate did a great job weve been talking the whole week we were trying to connect Then I didnt really get too many opportunities with him in the first couple games and not really too much on practice But we hooked up and I think that was just good communication throughout the week understanding what we see we did a good job watching film breaking these guys down and made some plays Hazels best catch of the night came on a 23yard reception in which he dragged both feet to secure the ball inbounds That was an incredible catch Sudfeld said I just tried to get my back shoulder throw it where they aint as we say throw it where theyre not So he made a great catch on it and I would like to see some of those on film I havent really seen them 4 Josh HarveyClemons comes through with the top defensive play of the night In a game were neither offense could get into the end zone through the first three quarters HarveyClemons finally logged the nights first touchdown on a 41yard picksix Tampa Bay quarterback Sifo Liufau tried to roll out on a play action pass and complete a pass to one of his wide receivers but the rookie linebacker took advantage of a an overthrown pass coupled with solid downfield blocking by the defense to score Its something we work on with the linebackers all the time HarveyClemons said Once you feel the flow of the running back and its a play action turn and find the crossing receiver and I got up under him and the quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play HarveyClemons felt putting the turnover on tape was important as he missed on other plays earlier in the game I missed a couple of sacks at the beginning and I was kind of down about that but its part of the game HarveyClemons said You just have to keep playing the next play and our defense played great and we held up tonight and thats all you can ask for 5 The Redskins have less than 48 hours before the initial 53man roster is set With the conclusion of Thursday nights game the Redskins are one step closer to the regular season But before they practice once again nearly half of the team will either be released or waived It is a tough reality in the NFL but one players arent unfamiliar with Still it makes the next few days very difficult Ive built a lot of relationships Brown said Like I said before Im thankful and were always going to be friends The guys that became friends were going to be friends after this Im just thankful to be on the field with you guys for the last time For Hazel meanwhile he said the wide receivers have never viewed it as a competition We just support each other when they make plays Hazel said Brian Quick James Quick made plays today Jamari Staples even got out there and made a couple plays So you just cheer your teammates on and really try to show some leadership Really thats it I dont ever really look at it like competition nothing like that Head coach Jay Gruden said the team will be ready to assemble the best 53man roster possible We have a full staff thats on board with that theyve been watching Gruden said of Saturdays cutdown process From training camp on they have been studying other teams We are not just going to wait for the waiver wire and look at it and say Oh my gosh these guys prepared They are anticipating what is going to happen around the league and

Kirk Cousins Colt McCoy Final Cuts 1 Nate Sudfeld Analysis As has been the case over the last twoplus years now Cousins is Washingtons starting quarterback with McCoy who has started 25 games in his NFL career serving as a veteran backup But for the first time in a few years now Washington has elected to go with just two quarterbacks on the initial 53man roster as they have waived Sudfeld a 2016 sixthround pick Sudfeld was on the active roster for the entirety of his rookie season but did not dress in any of the Redskins 16 regular season games The Indiana product did start Washingtons preseason finale on Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers completing 22of33 passes for 228 yards Even though he was among the players waived by Washington on Saturday the team remains high on his development and could bring him back on the practice squad Running Backs 4 Rob Kelley Samaje Perine Chris Thompson Mack Brown Final Cuts 2 Matt Jones Kenny Hilliard Analysis Just as they did during the final months of the regular season last year the Redskins will carry four running backs on the active roster Kelley of course returns as the teams starting running back and head coach Jay Gruden is steadfast in his praise of Thompson in the thirddown back role Washington also brought in Perine during the 2017 NFL Draft as the 5foot11 236pound bruiser provides Washington with a short yardage back that could solve some of the red zone struggles from 2016 While it was assumed all three would be on the active roster to start the year Brown was able to push his way back into the fold Brown may not have his number called early on the offensive side of the ball as the likely No 4 running back but he plays a vital role on special teams I liked what he brought to the team on special teams Gruden said last month Then he had a big breakout run against Chicago which was excellent Hes progressing Jones meanwhile was waived following two seasons in Washington after the Redskins selected him in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft The University of Florida product started the first seven games last year as the replacement for Alfred Morris but injuries and ball security issues coupled with the rise in production from Kelley resulted in the 24year old being inactive for the final nine games of the season Wide Receivers 5 Jamison Crowder Josh Doctson Terrelle Pryor Sr Ryan Grant Brian Quick Final Cuts 7 Robert Davis Maurice Harris Matt Hazel Levern Jacobs Zach Pascal James Quick Jamari Staples Analysis At one of the deepest position groups for the Redskins Washington is electing to start the season with five wide receivers as returners Crowder Grant and Doctson are joined this season by Pryor and Quick Washingtons top four receivers of Crowder Doctson Pryor and Grant seemingly were locked in but there was a tight battle for that last spot Quick edged out Davis and Harris though among others The veteran is coming off a career best season with the Los Angeles Rams as he recorded 41 receptions for 564 yards and three touchdowns As for the three starters on Washingtons unofficial depth chart Doctson Crowder and Pryor the hope is that the trio can produce in similar fashion to the way Crowder Pierre Garon and DeSean Jackson did last year Despite the Redskins waiving seven receivers Washington has ample options for the practice squad Davis was a sixthround pick in this years draft and had a strong showing during training camp Robert has done some good things not just catching the ball but blocking Ive been impressed with him Gruden said Were trying to run the ball Any time you want to be a physical running football team you have to have physical receivers to go in there and block safeties from time to time sometimes even linebackers Robert has proven he can do that Hes not afraid thats for sure Harris meanwhile went from practice squad to active roster last season recording eight receptions for 66 yards in 10 games while Hazel spent the final two months of 2016 on Washingtons practice squad Tight Ends 4 Jordan Reed Vernon Davis Niles Paul Jeremy Sprinkle Final Cuts 2 Manasseh Garner EJ Bibbs Analysis Just prior to Saturdays cutdown deadline the Redskins announced that they acquired a seventhround selection from the Rams in exchange for Derek Carrier Carrier spent two seasons with the Redskins and looked solid in his lone full offseason on the field in Washington but with so much depth at the position the team received compensation for the Beloit College product instead of outright releasing him As for the four tight ends that are on the active roster position coach Wes Phillips believes it is the deepest tight ends group in the NFL today and itd be hard to argue against that Reed of course is among the best at the position today while Davis has experienced a renaissance of sorts in Washington Last year the veteran recorded 44 receptions for 583 yards and two touchdowns Paul meanwhile can play multiple positions on offense including fullback while remaining one of the Redskins best special teams players Rounding out the group is Sprinkle a fifthround selection out of Arkansas While the 6foot5 252 pounder can be a pass catching threat Gruden believes Sprinkle is going to be a Y tight end in this league for a very long time Hes going to get stronger and stronger every year and hes got very good hands Gruden said Hes got deceptive speed but you really like him as an inline blocker Offensive Linemen 8 Shawn Lauvao Spencer Long Morgan Moses Ty Nsekhe Brandon Scherff Trent Williams Chase Roullier Tyler Catalina Final Cuts 8 Lucas Crowley Kyle Kalis John Kling Arie Kouandjio Kendall Pace Vinston Painter Ronald Patrick Isaiah Williams Analysis The Redskins return their starting offensive line from a year ago with Williams a fivetime Pro Bowler leading the way but theres two new faces in the room Roullier and Catalina have cracked the active roster as rookies although the two joined the Redskins on different paths Roullier is a sixthround pick out of Wyoming that has been thrusted into the spotlight recently with Long sidelined by a knee injury The 24yearold started Washingtons preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals and appeared on 40 snaps with the firstteam offensive unit He didnt look out of place against an aggressive Bengals frontseven just as he hadnt at all during training camp Hes done a great job he really has Gruden said For a rookie to come in here and handle all the things he has to handle its been very impressive Chase has got a ways to go obviously but hes on the right track Hes a true center He might have to play a little bit of guard from time to time If hes going to dress on game day hes going to have to back up guard and center So well get him going but the starting point is to really find a good center As for Catalina he joined Washingtons roster as a college free agent signing in May He has the versatility to play multiple spots along the line as was the case against the Buccaneers when he played at right tackle left tackle and right guard DEFENSE Defensive Linemen 6 Jonathan Allen Ziggy Hood Anthony Lanier II Stacy McGee Terrell McClain Matt Ioannidis Final Cuts 4 Brandon Banks Joey Mbu Ondre Pipkins AJ Francis Analysis One of the most difficult positions to gauge in terms of roster decisions throughout the preseason the defensive lines standing became a little bit clearer on Saturday with the decision to keep six defensive linemen on the active roster Hood returns as the elder statesman of the group as the 30yearold can play both end positions and nose tackle The Redskins also return secondyear linemen in the form of Lanier and Ioannidis both of whom the coaching staff is looking for an uptick in production this year Hes gotten a lot stronger in the weight room Gruden said of Ioannidis a fifthround pick for Washington last year Its kind of what I was hoping Getting him out of Temple hes just a big strong guy He works hard in the weight room Its led by Ziggy Hood Hes a great example for those guys those young guys with his work habits in the weight room He takes them all under his wing and Matts one of those guys thats just gotten so much stronger He gets great push in the pocket and hes playing good against the run so Ive been impressed with Matt McGee and McClain were signed within the first 24 hours of free agency opening up this year and the Redskins believe Allen can be a gamechanging player for years to come Everything that Ive seen so far from him from as a person character standpoint and athletic ability has been what we thought so hes going to be great addition for us for a long time Gruden said during training camp Any time youve got a big guy that can rush as a threetechnique this day and age especially third down thats a huge benefit for us He also is excellent against the run I think he proved that at Alabama his last year He was kind of known as just a pass rusher his junior year and then he came back his senior year and wanted to show people he was really a good run defender and he did that Allaround defensive end defensive tackle its going to really help us Linebackers 10 Ryan Kerrigan Zach Brown Mason Foster Preston Smith Will Compton Martrell Spaight Chris Carter Josh HarveyClemons Junior Galette Ryan Anderson Final Cuts 5 Nico Marley Pete Robertson Ron Thompson Jr Lynden Trail Zach Vigil Analysis In terms of the outside linebackers this group is once again headlined by Kerrigan a twotime Pro Bowler who is already third alltime in franchise history in sacks This year he is joined once again by Smith along with Carter Galette and Anderson After spending his first two seasons in Washington on Injured Reserve with Achilles tears Galette finally returned to the field last weekend and showed some of his famous burst off the line With Trent Murphy sidelined for the year theyll need a healthy and productive Galette on game days At inside linebacker the Redskins are still determining how the depth will stack up there but Foster and Brown started the second and third preseason games HarveyClemons cracked the 53man roster after capping off his first NFL preseason slate with a 41yard picksix Thursday night The college safety is still trying to adjust to a new position as a dime linebacker but he was happy to showcase his progress with the interception Its something we work on as linebackers all the time HarveyClemons said of the play Once you feel the flow of the running back and its a play action I turned found the crossing receiver and I got up under him The quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play Cornerbacks 6 Josh Norman Bashaud Breeland Quinton Dunbar Fabian Moreau Joshua Holsey Kendall Fuller Final Cuts 2 Tevin Homer Jeremiah McKinnon Analysis While Norman and Breeland are the starters once again on the outside Washingtons depth at this position really impressed during training camp Fuller took over the nickel cornerback position at the start of camp and looked more comfortable with a fully healthy offseason under his belt Last year the 2016 thirdround pick was still recovering from a torn ACL that limited his speed some I think hes more confident in the injury that hes coming off of Gruden said He looks stronger he looks faster so its good to see Hes moving around also hes playing some nickel playing some corner and hes doing a fine job Moreau meanwhile flashed in Washingtons second preseason game against the Green Bay Packers with two big special teams plays while also showing the ability to hang with speedy wide receivers Its no joke what hes putting out there on the field Norman said of Moreau Obviously hes going to be a great talent in this league to come But hes still going to work on some things Well get him better each and every day Hes going to work with us Were going to get him to the level he needs to be Safeties 5 DJ Swearinger Sua Cravens Deshazor Everett Montae Nicholson Stefan McClure Final Cuts 2 Will Blackmon Fish Smithson Analysis Just as Everett did two years ago although at the cornerback position McClure has made the active roster after being signed during training camp In Washingtons four preseason games McClure recorded 11 tackles along with two passes defensed ad a sack This position group though features Swearinger and Cravens Swearinger was one of Washingtons free agent additions and has provided the defense with a vocal leader Im a natural leader from birth Swearinger said My mom told me that been telling me that all my life You know she told me to lead not to follow and lead first and foremost and thats what you know a lot of the energy the excitement and when we get people lined up thats where a lot of that comes from Cravens meanwhile has moved back to safety after spending his rookie season at inside linebacker SPECIAL TEAMS Kicker 1 Dustin Hopkins Final

       " 2111: 'The Washington Redskins found their security blanket in Chris Thompson an excellent third down back who signed a multiyear contract extension on Tuesday Chris Thompson can finally relax knowing his home will continue to reside in Washington for at least another few years The 26yearold running back signed a contract extension Tuesday something he said had been making him nervous for days now I felt like a kid going to school for the first day Thompson said I couldnt sleep I was ready to give up and come here this morning I wanted to cry last night because I knew this was coming this morning Little bit of mixed emotions but of course Im happy about it Thompson had been previously playing under a oneyear tender he signed in the offseason Now that a longerterm deal has been inked Thompson expressed his eagerness to focus purely on football Im just glad we were able to get something done and thats out the window now he said I wasnt worried about it earlier I was just focusing on having a great year this year but now thats out of the way I feel good Thompsons transition to the NFL was anything but smooth after being drafted by the Redskins in the fifth round in 2013 During his rookie season the young tailback underwent shoulder surgery keeping him off the field for a large portion of the year He failed to make the initial 53man roster in 2014 and spent time on the practice squad before finally getting an opportunity to see some game time later that year His amount of carries nearly doubled from 2015 to 2016 and he averaged 55 yards per run through the two seasons earning him the title of security blanket on the offense Just being consistent thats been my biggest focus just trying to be consistent and just being the same guy being the same player every single day Thompson said Head coach Jay Gruden one of Thompsons advocates expressed his delight in the extension and praised his running backs work ethic Hes a coachs dream quite frankly and you want those guys to succeed because it trickles down in the building Gruden said Guys like that when you see them get rewarded the younger guys see what it takes to get rewarded and it rubs off on the younger players So its great to have a leader like Chris Gruden also said that while there may be some bigger names at running back on the roster there were few more dependable than Thompson especially in the red zone and on third down Through four seasons Thompson also acted as another weapon for quarterback Kirk Cousins in the passing game snagging 90 receptions and five touchdowns Weve gotten to the point where Kirk trusted me Thompson said Thats what every receiver running back wants from their quarterback to just have that trust in you The coaches trust in me and thats all I ever wanted Though he received support and encouragement from the coaching staff and team during the offseason Thompson said there was hardly ever a moment where he felt his job was completely secure He said he recognized the uncertainty that comes with playing in the NFL but was glad to have a home for the next two years I had my doubts I had them all along ever since I made it in this league Thompson said I started to improve my last couple years so I figured something would come along and we were finally able to get something done Like I said before Im happy about it Im excited about the opportunity to be here with my boys a little longer',\n",

       " 2176: 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Hes done a better job handling the burnout from preseasons past One of the concerns that quarterback Kirk Cousins had after last season was his stamina He noticed that he didnt balance his time and energy in the most efficient way leaving him feeling a little burned out facing the Steelers for the season opener As part of his ongoing evolution as a starting quarterback Cousins took better care of himself during training camp and the preseason managing how much energy he exerted throughout the grind of August I would say Ive done a better job managing it Cousins said I feel that each year Im going to get better at handling my role and how to be best prepared each week Its been a good offseason Im ready to go Feel like the last six weeks through training camp and through preseason games its never been perfect but its been a good six weeks Weve done all we can to be ready for this first game Cousins did also mention that while his wife is expecting a baby very soon he will react accordingly which is a different kind of preparation I think the plan is to not have a plan Cousins said In a sense that if I can be there Im going to be there if I cant I cant Im going to get there as fast as I can whenever my commitment is over 2 Hes still comfortable with Josh Doctson despite not playing with him much over the past month The most concern the offense might still have is how wide receiver Josh Doctson will fare after a lingering hamstring injury has sidelined him for most of the preseason Hes missed all but three games over the last year including a preseason game this year which has cut down on time Cousins has had to gain a rapport with him Still Cousins says hes comfortable with Doctson lining up with the offense crediting his natural abilities as a receiver to help transcend the time lost He was able to watch last year and sit in on meetings and learn our offense Cousins said He knows what it should look like he watched some really good players some veteran players do it last year It doesnt take a lot of time to get him going We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here We just got to continue to get him opportunities As for what kind of natural instincts Doctson has shown Cousins had a long list Natural hands tracks the ball well Hes got good speed he jumps well great size long arms Cousins said Smart player laidback personality doesnt take things too seriously in the sense that he just goes out there and enjoys the game and plays He tracks the ball really well in the air which is a tough skill to be able to have 3 The Eagles pass rush is something Cousins always has to respect Cousins said he could talk a lot about what the Eagles do on defense but he emphasized the pass rush not just the players such as Fletcher Cox but the scheme Ive always respected Coach Schwartz and their defense and the way they come after you Cousins said Just constantly put pressure even sometimes with only three or four rushers you still feel them Ive always respected Malcolm Jenkins as a safety and really the entire unit I think Jordan Hicks is a very good Mike linebacker hes a smart player you can tell hes a good leader for them Mychal Kendricks has always been a guy that plays fast plays downhill hell strike you Just a lot of respect all the way around Very versatile players that can do multiple things Its going to be a good challenge While the Redskins have won the last five games against the Eagles and Cousins has found success he also knows that the Eagles have played intelligently against them When you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience he said Its going to be a really good challenge and its what you expect Week 1 RedskinsEagles I think itll live up to how intense you expect it to be 4 He feels very good about his third down options with everyone healthy on the firstteam offense Its no question Cousins is feeling more assured about Sunday knowing he will have all of his offensive weapons at his disposal Injuries for the most part have subsided in time for the opener and while there hasnt been much time to find a rhythm Cousins is looking forward to seeing what he can do with his numerous options Part of the equation will be relying on tight end Jordan Reed and running back Chris Thompson on third downs two players who have become reliable targets when the offense is in a bind and needs a first down I dont feel a need to go look elsewhere to find somebody in those two roles Cousins said Both very natural great players Im sure it helps to have other guys who complement them Chris Thompson outside with Terrelle Pryor Sr and Josh Doctson and Ryan Grant and on and on Vernon Davis When you can have other guys thrown into the mix it hopefully keeps defenses guessing opens up lanes for Jamison Crowder and Jordan Theyre a big help to our offense They show up in big moments thats what great players do Were going to need them to do that on Sunday If we can stay healthy its going to give us a major advantage later in the year We work for that train for that and we do have some depth thats going to be an advantage for us hopefully down the road Id like to think we get all of our guys going spread the ball around let them all show what they can do and give us a lot that the defense has to focus on 5 Cousins has a new nook and personal office space at the facility and hes very excited about it Cousins posted a photo on Instagram recently about his excitement over a new small office at the Redskins facility It provides Cousins an opportunity to prepare somewhere other than the quarterbacks room which he cedes to other position groups during the week Now he has all of his papers and binders and fun trinkets in one spot and he couldnt help but smile about all of it on Wednesday I like a place to kind of leave my stuff and have notes and a white board and thoughts that I can have organized old binders that I have kept and just have them stock piled up Cousins said There really wasnt a place to do that that I could have access to it at all times We found an old nook is the best word I can think of Its really not an office but it works for me Ms Bj our secretary did a good job of getting it dressed up for me and we have talked about maybe putting saloon doors on it because there are no doors right now We were told we wont be able to put a door on it so maybe saloon doors or maybe hippie beads coming down from the ceiling I dont know On his desk sits a Jeff Foxworthy peel off calendar some Michael Scott toys from The Office and a white board with a quote from Muhammad Ali Essentially it says the fight is won or lost long before I dance under the lights Cousins said That is what he used to say so I put that there just as a reminder when Im in there that often times the game can be won or lost right here when you see something or you find a tip or a piece of information that can make a difference So it is just a good reminder I thought it was a fitting quote for what that room should be about',\n",

       " 2257: 'After being cut by the Falcons last week quarterback Alek Torgensen received a spot on the Redskins practice squad where he will begin his development at the position Upon his release from the Atlanta Falcons last Friday Alek Torgersen flew to New York City with a bag packed of essentials to visit some friends He waited for his phone to ring not sure if any NFL team would give him another shot until Sunday when the Redskins offered the rookie quarterback a spot on their practice squad I got the call to come here and I was ready to go my bags were packed nice easy flight from New York and it was a lot of fun he said after his first day of practice A whirlwind of emotions the lowest lows and the highest highs its been a crazy experience so far Had that call not taken place had the Redskins not waived quarterback Nate Sudfeld and no other teams found his talents necessary Torgersen was ready to travel to Oslo Norway where his father was born raised and now lives coaching a womens crew team Now hell wait to go at a later date Torgersen grew up in the same house in Huntington Beach Calif for the first 18 years of his life his mother is from Orange County but he has made numerous visits to Norway where his grandmother and aunt still live as well Despite the 12hour flights from California he tries to go back as often as possible to see them because they havent been around that much in my life said Torgersen who has never spoken the language fluently His visits provide him a unique cultural perspective that might help him as he learns to adapt to another culture in Washington For now he is understandably taking things one day at a time as he adjusts to a new environment learns a new playbook and gets to know his new teammates The University of Pennsylvania product played in the EastWest Shrine game thats where he first caught head coach Jay Grudens eyes but didnt receive an invitation to the NFL Combine in February He had to rely on a body of work that he accrued over four years in Philadelphia and a Pro Day workout throwing to receivers he hadnt played with before His credentials include being Penns alltime leader in passing touchdowns 52 completion percentage 651 and total offense 7937 yards along with being a twotime firstteam AllIvy selection I think at Penn he had a good career and then I watched every throw that he had in the EastWest Shrine game and I thought he had a good quick arm and an accurate arm Gruden said The Redskins had thought about bringing him in after the draft but were hesitant about having four quarterbacks on the roster Instead the Falcons gave him a chance signing him as a college free agent but with Matt Ryan and Matt Schaub just recently signing a contract extension ahead of him his only opportunity was to impress coaches enough so they might consider a third spot on the quarterback depth chart In three preseason games Torgersen was afforded just 20 pass attempts completing eight of them for 95 yards with two interceptions With little opportunity to find a rhythm his introduction to the NFL has been turbulent and even Torgersen said that theres a lot of mystery about me right now Coming from college to the pros its a big jump Torgersen said Youre going to take a big leap right away I felt like I made a very large leap in my game I got a lot better but I need to push myself a little more to get a little more better Initially its going to be big and these next steps are going to be smaller so youve got to look at that and find what youre doing well and remember that you are doing better Torgersens biggest goals are to work on the mental aspects of his game namely making better and faster reads and increasing his foot speed but he believes he has the talent to play in the league The adjustments will happen through osmosis experiencing an entire season with Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy asking for help and knowing that his development wont be rushed I asked him today I said Is your head spinning or how do you feel Hes handling it well Cousins said It is a lot to pick up He does a good job of understanding a lot of the big terms and techniques he really has picked it up quickly The challenge is in all the little nuances That takessometimes years Cousins even said hes been picking Torgersons brain a little bit about Atlantas offensive schemes and is enjoying meeting new people collecting new people to be able to have those relationships and hear their story and learn from them Kirks generally taken an interest in my life wanted to get to know me Torgersen said So I look forward to getting to know him a little better in these next couple months and just happy to be here Because of this new job hell postpone that trip to see his father a former crew star himself coaching at his former club in Oslo at least until the offseason Torgersen said hes not sure if he could handle crew himself but had considered taking it up if football didnt pan out after high school So far football has panned out Enough to give him another chance in the NFL Its going to take a little time a little bit of an adjustment period for me but Im ready to take on the challenge Torgersen said Its a lot fun to learn a new offense learn a new system and meet some new guys',\n",
       " 2266: 'Redskins head coach Jay Grudens roots in calling plays dates back to his days in the AFL Now back in the role of play caller Gruden former colleagues and current players reflect on his success The Nashville Kats were on their way to winning the Arena Football Leagues Eastern Division in the summer of 1997 Jay Gruden a 30yearold rookie offensive coordinator with a head of shaggy brown hair a bright smile and puffy cheeks toiled along their sidelines Nashvilles defensive coordinator Pat Sperduto a longtime friend and former teammate of Grudens walked over to talk before a game In his hand Sperduto clutched his call sheet meticulously organized with plays for different personnel groupings and downs and distances all typed up and laminated Hey wheres your call sheet Sperduto asked Gruden Gruden sunk his hand into one of his pockets and retrieved a crumpled page of yellow legal paper Grinning he presented it to Sperduto What is that Sperduto said Oh just some plays for me to remember Gruden replied A few scribbled notes were all Gruden needed to supplement his gut and an almost photographic memory for football plays He just has it says Sperduto now a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs Whatever it is as far as just a feel and an understanding its pretty impressive It passes through Grudens synapses on Redskins Sundays now When the Redskins kick off their 2017 season on Sunday at FedExField against the Philadelphia Eagles Gruden will again be calling the plays on offense after letting Sean McVay handle those duties the past two years Led by its passing game Washington has had backtoback winning seasons for the first time in two decades and yet it seems the organization could be heading in any direction Last year the defense was among the leagues worst The Redskins missed the playoffs Kirk Cousins future with the franchise remains uncertain If Gruden can keep Washingtons offense near the top of the league for a thirdconsecutive year that it factor might become the most compelling reason for Cousins to stay Grudens life has prepared him well for this task He began cataloging route concepts in his mind as a kid watching Joe Montana run Bill Walshs offense Over more than three decades of playing and coaching in college the Arena League and the NFL he developed quick pattern recognition In hundreds of conversations with his brother Jon in the driveway on the phone and from the press box into Jons earpiece on the Tampa Bay sideline he spitballed ideas for how to break a defense There are traces of all those experiences in Washingtons offense today The origins of a Gruden offense Gruden got to see the West Coast offense revolutionize the NFL in real time In 1977 he watched Montana quarterback Notre Dame to a national championship when his dad Jim was a running backs coach for the Irish In 1982 after Jim moved the family to Tampa for a job with the Buccaneers Jay still had a close tie to Montana through Freddie Solomon the 49ers wide receiver and the primary target on The Catch who spent his offseasons there As a high schooler with NFL ambitions Gruden spent his offseasons working out with Solomon learning the same lessons in fundamentals quarterback play and routerunning that Solomon a former quarterback was getting from Bill Walsh the other seven months of the year It was through their Super Bowl runs Gruden says Freddie Solomon was there Jerry Rice But Joe Montana was the main guy he and Bill Walsh were the guys that I really studied and followed because thats who we wanted to win you know Grudens time in the AFL helped him think creatively about play design and hone his innate ability for calling games but he says the spacing of the field about a third of the size of a regulation field is so different from the outdoor game that the schematics dont transfer over Instead Gruden inherited the core concepts and fundamental beliefs of the Redskins passing game and some of the running game from his brothers coaching tree The Paul Hacketts and Mike Holmgren and obviously Bill Walsh all those guys that Jon learned from and he used I learned from him and were engraved in my head Gruden says Watch the Redskins this season and youll still see a lot of quick passes highpercentage throws and three or fivestep drops Youll see Gruden get his running backs involved in the passing game In an average season his NFL offenses have thrown 83 passes to running backs and gained 518 yards on those plays Theyre going to hit all areas of the field You know were going to get screens nakeds boots all the things that come off the running game said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis the head coach in Cincinnati when Gruden was offensive coordinator there from 201113 Youll also see concepts that Gruden has developed on his own particularly in the deep passing game where hes come up with route combinations that are more Madden than Montana His designs have helped Cousins who led the league with 485 air yards per passing attempt and completed 475 percent of passes that traveled 20 yards or further last season grow from a game manager into an effective deep thrower That is in part a product of the personnel you cant nickel and dime with DeSean Jackson but Gruden has long been a clever architect with the deep ball We had no vertical passing game in Tampa until he got here Jon Gruden says I can remember Jay coming up with some routes you cant just run a straight go route you cant just run a deep cross every time you have to come up with some different types of vertical passes and Jay was really good at helping us do that Jon posits that the AFL did influence his brother schematically in at least one way Receivers cant run out of bounds in the AFL because when Jay played and coached there were only inches of space between the sidelines and the hockeystyle boards enclosing the arena Running straight down the field wasnt a good option Youd run right into the boards and break your neck Jon Gruden says Know what I mean But you can start across the field and then put your foot in the ground and then go back deep where you came from to the opposite pylon When Jon Gruden finally coaxed his brother into coaching with him in Tampa in 2002 Jay used his understanding of spacing and leverage to come up with all sorts of deep angles routes called rage or star routes or code reds He came up with all these crazy vertical double moves that I certainly hadnt thought of Jon Gruden says A long history of calling plays This offseason Gruden has fielded a legion of questions about his return to calling plays His responses have contained traces of confusion and annoyance like hes being asked over and over if hes comfortable breathing His brothers reaction is sharper If Jay Grudens not as good a playcaller as anybody in the league I mean I disagree Jon Gruden says I know what he knows I know what hes done and I know what his role has been in Washington Its not like he just stood there with his foot in his mouth the last two years Come on I mean give me a break Gruden was the Redskins offensive playcaller in 2014 before McVay was given that title and responsibility He called plays in Cincinnati too Finding the start of Grudens playcalling days though requires going back much further Back even before he was on the sideline in Nashville Back to when he was a player Gruden chose Louisville for college in part because of coach Howard Schnellenbergers prostyle offense which asked a lot of him as a young quarterback And when he was with the Tampa Bay Storm coach Lary Kuharich insisted that quarterbacks call their plays I dont know if theres many people out there that have that ability like Jay does where it just came so easy and so natural to him says Sperduto In addition to coaching with Gruden in Nashville Sperduto was one of his linemen in Tampa Bay As teammates they won multiple ArenaBowl championships in the early 1990s It was clear from being in the huddle with Gruden Sperduto says that he knew how to minimize an opponents best pass rusher or motion to get a mismatch and that it all came naturally to him at gamespeed By the time Gruden was calling plays off crumpled sheets of paper in Nashville he was already comfortable as a playcaller He was very aware of everything that was going on in the game and he knew how to attack personnel knew a great deal about the opponents personnel and where the weak spots were says Ed Khayat the former Redskins Eagles and Boston Patriots defensive lineman who hired Gruden as coach of the Kats in 1997 When Jay Gruden joined his brothers Buccaneers as an offensive assistant in 2002 he got a chance to use that awareness in the NFL game Jon and Jay Gruden were connected by their headsets Jon on the sideline and Jay watching from the press box for seven years Even in his first year with the team Jay Gruden didnt hesitate to speak up during a critical situation Jon Gruden remembers one play during Super Bowl XXXVII which the Buccaneers won 4821 against the Oakland Raiders where Jays it factor was on display The Bucs were already up 10 points before halftime and facing a firstandgoal from the Raiders 5yard line Jay Grudens voice shot into Jons earpiece Hey Get to 374 Wasp Jon Gruden called it Bucs wide receiver Keenan McCardell split out wide to the right and ran a fly route right at Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson then stopped Quarterback Brad Johnson made the throw and McCardell caught it over his back shoulder for a touchdown It stung them pretty good Jon says The task this year Right now the Redskins future is murky The offseason was defined by changes made to the defense which must improve for the team to have success But if Washington remains in the playoff picture and posts a thirdconsecutive winning season itll likely be for the same reason as last two they scored points Should those things happen the comfort of an offense thats helped him pass for 4000 yards in backtoback seasons and a coach who has backed him and helped him succeed may be the Redskins best chance to convince Cousins to stay Its not fair to put that all on Gruden but whats fair is not always whats relevant at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va Its also not accurate to say that Washington needs only to recreate its offensive output of the last two seasons to have success Weve got to figure out a way to be balanced Gruden says Not just at the beginning of the year but at the end of the year I think sometimes when you have so many weapons everybodys like Man Jordan Jamison Josh Terrelle Just throw the ball every snap But I think our offense is best when we can run the ball be physical Historically Gruden hasnt been as passhappy as his reputation indicates Only twice in the last six seasons has a Gruden offense ranked in the top half of the league by passing play percentage One of those seasons was 2016 in Washington however when the Redskins threw more often than all but seven other teams That imbalance put up numbers but it also led to problems most acutely in the red zone The Redskins were 30th in the league in touchdown percentage inside the 20yard line where Cousins completion percentage dropped from 67 to 4578 I think Jays one of those guys thats going to go off feel says starting running back Rob Kelley If he feels like were killing in the run game hes going to run it If he feels like were picking up in the pass game hes going to pass it Hes one of those guys where youve got to show him that you can stop it The Redskins will try to rededicate themselves to the ground game If that succeeds they hope it will help their play action game as well a strength of Cousins Beyond those things the Redskins offense wont look terribly different this year to the average viewer Its always been Jays offense at the end of the day Cousins says So even though Sean was involved in the past the fact that Jay is the one calling it now theres not a lot of change because it was always Jays system And he was very involved in the gameplanning and even in the gameday play calling decisions And yes they will still throw the fade I only called it like six times all year for Gods sakes Gruden says Its just they were 0for6 Selfdeprecation aside hes serious Just watch Cincinnati tape Gruden says The reason Im sitting here today is because we threw the fade He loves the fade confirms AJ Green A constant competitor Gruden still uses the word quit to describe his decision to go into coaching Back then in 1997 his goal of playing quarterback in the NFL still felt within his reach He had a young family to support though and wanted to give them security Had he gotten hurt playing hed have lost his source of income Khayat offered him a 57000 guaranteed salary as offensive coordinator in Nashville Gruden took it Gruden is glad he made the choice to give his wife Sherry and their three boys stability He was around to coach his sons basketball teams and go to their school events Still stepping off the field was hard I loved playing so much Gruden says It was hard to walk away because it didnt make sense to Gruden that multiple AFL titles as a player hadnt gotten him more than a developmental squad stint with the Dolphins that was so short he never got a playbook Hes still bitter that he never got a shot in the NFL Jon Gruden says I still think hes mad at me because I didnt sign him as a player He said What do you mean coach Im better than Donald Hollas I can still hear him saying I can beat out Ty Detmer in Philadelphia Grudens awshucks exterior sometimes masks this but hes a competitor who sees everything as an opportunity to show hes a winner Sperduto recalls 20minute arguments over who called a Jeopardy answer first At the NFL Combine this March Gruden sought him out in the stands of Lucas Oil Stadium and told him to download Words With Friends so I can whoop your ass Competitive banter has always been a hallmark of Grudens personality Hes the same person he was in his 20s playing for the Storm teasing Sperduto and his other linemen after they let him take a hit You honestly felt guilty not protecting him to the fullest says Sperduto recalling the pit hed feel in his stomach watching Gruden pick himself up off the turf You really felt like it was letting him down Im Italian Ive got that Italian mother guilt complex he plays on that big time Like Dont worry I dont need my back Youd feel so guilty Sperduto recalls As a coach Gruden still motivates with that biting sense of humor When Gruden came to Washington in 2014 some players mistook his easy demeanor for a lack of discipline or intensity Now entering his fourth season his contract extended through 2020 Gruden has grown comfortable being in control Im comfortable with people around me Gruden says We have a great staff and Ive gotten to know the players My first year here I didnt know anybody playerwise Nobody And theyre set in their ways and Well we didnt do it like this last year But I think everybodys gotten to know me a little bit more and I think everybodys more comfortable being around each other Now the Redskins often describe Gruden as a players coach Most in the locker room feel a sense of loyalty to him They say he hasnt forgotten what its like to be in their shoes When

was brilliant during training camp wowing fans with acrobatic catch after acrobatic catch But he showed room for improvement during the preseason struggling to retain some of his targets Doctson meanwhile oozes talent but could not stay healthy his rookie season as he appeared in just two games Even though the 2015 unanimous AllAmerican is still somewhat of a mystery Cousins thinks his natural abilities could make up for lost time on the field We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Cousins said Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here Weve just got to continue to give him opportunities Cousins understands that the task ahead wont be easy even if Doctson is at full health making players Last season the Pro Bowler threw two pick sixes against Philadelphia They do have a good scheme Cousins said Then when you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience Its going to be a really

ExemptLeft Squad list head coach Jay Gruden called upon the next man up Deshazor Everett to take his place Everett fought his way onto Washingtons active roster after transitioning from cornerback to safety His best game at safety came during the Redskins victory over the Eagles last December as he recorded his first career interception on a throw into the end zone by Carson Wentz I think he will do a good job Gruden said Its just a matter of lining up correctly getting the calls communicating with DJ Swearinger and making plays I know the one thing he can do he can tackle He is not afraid Everett will be tasked with corralling Philadelphias much improved receiving corps led by new addition Alshon Jeffery Everett will have help from cornerback Josh Norman when guarding Jeffery but when it comes to deep jumpballs Jefferys specialty the tall receiver has the height advantage Theyve got some guys that can go deep on you Everett said Theyve got some big body guys Jeffery Theyve got a guy in the slot that can do everything a gadget guy Theyve got Sproles who can line up at tailback and could split out and catch passes on screens First down second down goal line they just do it all Brandon Hill REPEAT LAST YEARS GROUND GAME PRODUCTION VS PHILLY While the Redskins were inconsistent running the ball last season two of Washingtons best ground performances came against Philadelphia In a Week 6 2720 victory Washingtons tailbacks combined for 230 rushing yards Then in December Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson each scored touchdowns as the duo combined for more than 100 yards on just 19 carries Gruden said this week that the offense despite so many weapons out wide is at its worst when theyre not multidimensional Center Spencer Long echoed the coachs sentiment saying it will take a unit effort to make sure Washingtons ground game anchors a well balanced attack Its just being consistent all 11 guys and clicking on all cylinders and that means backtiming on the offensive line not missing blocks the edges holding up the tight ends knowing their assignments Long said It just takes everybody so to have an efficient run game in this league everyones got to be on and a hat and on their assignments Thats what weve got to do Washingtons rushing attack could be a threeheaded effort with Kelley and Thompson this year joined by rookie Samaje Perine a powerful runner who set Oklahomas career rushing record last year But the group will be led by Kelley once again Washingtons starter for the final nine games last year Settled into his role this year after clawing for time at the beginning of last season Gruden expects a jump in Kelleys production He knows protections running lanes the steps the footwork and all that stuff Gruden said Hes a lot more comfortable or more natural where now he can get the ball in his hands and do his thing Been impressed with how hes progressed from his rookie year to now Stephen Czarda DONT LET THE BALL FLY OFF WENTZ HAND Redskins fans and players alike experienced the true potential of quarterback Carson Wentz in the most recent matchup between these division rivals In the teams most recent meeting the thenrookie impressed completing 32 of his 46 passes for 314 yards and a touchdown Wentz had the Redskins defense on the ropes late in the fourth quarter as well until Ryan Kerrigan s gamesealing strip sack with under a minute to go removed all doubt Wentzs performance that day represented one of the few bright spots in what was a tough second half of the season for him He claimed the spotlight early on in the season putting up passer ratings of 1010 866 1259 and 1028 in his first four games as a pro but those numbers soon began to fade His average passer rating dipped to 721 in the last nine games of the season Despite his inconsistency Wentz showed flashes of a franchise quarterback in his rookie season Hes a good quarterback he definitely is Everett said He can throw the ball well He has mobility You cant just give him a title of Hes a pocket passer or Hes a runner because hell run to create or hell sit in the pocket until hes hit and delivers a throw Thats maturity of the quarterback The 24yearold enters his second season in the league with somewhat of a new supporting cast Jeffery looks to be replacing Jordan Matthews in the top wide receiver spot after signing with the team this offseason while fellow newcomer Torrey Smith is projected to start alongside him at wideout Additionally LeGarrette Blount will anchor the backfield after his standout season in New England The Redskins need to a find a way to frustrate him so that he cant get into a tempo with a rebuilt offense We have to try to get them some thirdandlongs and put our hand in the dirt and let Ryan Kerrigan and Junior

justice in trying to move forward in life and trying to make things better I try to take an optimistic approach Its not always the case but as much as possible When you went through your suspension last year did it challenge that mindset Yeah it was challenging In what way It was something I had to go through that I didnt necessarily felt like it should have happened You try to stay positive through that How did you stay positive Just standing around the team standing around the guys They did a good job and they helped me out a lot When your leadership was questioned by the outside did you feel like that was fair Thats life The thing about it is as long as the guys in the locker room werent questioning it its really all that matters Thats who you set out to lead thats who you set out to influence Everybody on the outside can question all they want but it really has no bearing on me until you step between these doors Did you feel like you were always someone who could lead a group of men No I didnt A lot of people say naturalborn leader I probably wouldnt be in that category If you think about it the characteristics of a naturalborn leader I just havent always been that talker a guy that likes to be the center of attention In that sense no In the sense of me being able to relate to people and me being able to uplift guys and try to help people stay positive I think in that way When did you feel like that started Coach Mike Shanahan did a lot for me when I first got into the NFL Guys really dont follow words they follow actions Thats why you tend to see more often than not the captains of the team usually have the play to back it up With the NFL being such a revolving door people who do tend to stick around are the people who put out a relatively good product on the field I think that has a direct correlation to leadership Thats only half the battle Being able to relate to your teammates being able to gain their trust As an offensive lineman do you think of yourself as a protector Is that the mentality you have Protector I guess you could say that I feel like were more of a specialops unit like infantry We all work as a group and our success the teams success the offenses success it directly correlates to how we do how well we play together Do you know a lot about specialops units No Watching movies Specialops SWAT team Seal Team 6 you call in a group of guys to come get a job done nobody does it singlehandedly I feel like that more so how we come in we come in as a group with a lot of camaraderie really cohesive and our success really hinges on that being able to play together and understand each other and to have that bond I have to say Im still amazed at your Silverback gorilla back tattoo Laughing Whats the origin of that nickname It just came at school man At Oklahoma Yeah So how did that come about Its a lot of ways the attitude kind of for the most part laid back just real chill and when the time is needed switch the flip on Do whats needed How long did it take to get that tattoo 12 hours It was broken up into two sessions seven and five What do you do for all that time Shoot there aint much you can do It sucks Whats the best piece of advice youve ever received I think a piece of advice I tell myself every day is control what you can control And what you cant control dont let it worry you A lot of people worry themselves with things thats so far out of their control you cant really do nothing about it Is there an example of how that manifests for you Just everyday life You ask me about watching the news a lot of people sit and watch the news and get terrified of whats going on in the world and what decision are being made You cant control any of that Kind of like the flooding in Houston Right Mother Nature nobody can control Thats different lifethreatening stuff I noticed the other day at practice offensive line coach Bill Callahan took you guys onto the side field so you couldnt listen to music during drills Laughing Yeah Is that the worst part of his drills Yeah hes the reason the music really wasnt playing in the beginning of practice Because you like playing DJ right I aint gonna say I like playing DJ but music really does help get through the monotony of practice and helps keep the juices flowing so having the music around does help But Coach Callahan does a lot of talking and teaching He hates having to talk over the music so thats why hes against it So you just have to negotiate The only thing thats being negotiated is if he dont want it he dont want it As you prepare for the season opener against the Eagles is it clich for you to say youre ready Is there any apprehension or extreme confidence in yourself as you approach the start I dont think apprehension would be the right word Youre kind of a little nervous just because its the first game of the year These blows really count You dont want to take a loss I mean theres a lot of stuff going into it Youre not certain You know how you want the season to go and no ones certain how high it will go You dont know man theres a lot of uncertainty theres a lot of optimism theres a lot of nervous energy I feel like this is the longest part of the year if you include the four preseason games and you have a few more days all the way until this game How do you get through that to stay sharp There aint really much you can do thats why it seems so long Is the experience of walking through the tunnel still a thrill for you Its always a thrill anytime you go through that tunnel The season opener everybody is so amped up for it youve got literally months and months to look forward to what games have got to be played on the schedule Open up with a divisional opponent who weve had some battles with always adds a little more to the opening night factor',\n",

       " 2909: 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was a eightplay 69yard drive capped by running back Chris Thompson bludgeoning and eluding three defenders en route to the end zone After an interception return for touchdown by linebacker Ryan Kerrigan and ensuing defensive stop the Redskins offense continued the momentum near the end of the second quarter in their 3017 loss to the Eagles Sunday afternoon At the time trailing by six points quarterback Kirk Cousins and the offense put together their first real sustained drive of the game marching 69 yards from their own 31yard line thanks in large part to a titanic effort from running back Chris Thompson On the eighth play of the drive Thompson ran outside and then streaked up the right hash where Cousins hit him with a pass in stride Waiting for him in the middle of the field were three Eagles defenders all of whom were tossed aside as Thompson took a couple big hits spun and eluded the grasp of their depleted efforts He then sprinted the extra 15 yards into the end zone tying the game with less than two minutes before the half I really cant break down what happened what I was thinking Thompson said It was just something that happened on that play I was just looking to make a big play As an offense we werent prepared for them at the level that I thought we were capable of For me I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play The drive began with an incompletion to running back Rob Kelley but he took the next handoff for four yards On third down Cousins found wide receiver Ryan Grant for 10 yards to move the chains sparking the rest of the drive Cousins completed a pass to tight end Jordan Reed for five yards then connected with Thompson for a fiveyard pass that narrowly gained the yardage necessary for a first down Thompson a heavy contributor on this drive took the next handoff for a fouryard rush before collecting the touchdown pass that would ultimately give the Redskins the lead with a Dustin Hopkins field goal Thats my job said Thompson who signed a contract extension earlier in the week Ive got to make plays with the amount of snaps that I get Ive got to come in Ive got to make plays right away It got us up but by halftime we were down again For me Ive got to come in in the second half and just make more plays',\n",
       " 2930: 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 1 game against the Philadelphia Eagles that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 With time to take over the game with less than two minutes left Washingtons last effort ended with a fumble returned for touchdown After the defense held stout on a sixplay 33yard drive that resulted in Philadelphia only extending their lead to five points Washington had time to go into their twominute offense and strike for a gamewinning score But on the second play of a drive that started with 159 left on the game clock Kirk Cousins was strip sacked before Fletcher Cox scoped up the ball and returned it for a 20yard touchdown The play went under review as Cousins thought the he didnt fumble but the referees upheld the call on the field There are so many times where I am decisively saying Oh its worked out this way Then I go back and look at it and say Im completely wrong In the moment what do I know Im just playing Cousins said But right away I looked back the ref and went like this motioning arm forward and my arms going forward But they have time to take a look at it and get it right They made the call they made So Im not going to lose sleep over that Its the plays that led up to the moment and those are the ones that I want back That fumble was part of a difficult afternoon for the offensive unit as they finished the day 0for2 in the red zone threefor10 on third downs and had four turnovers Its frustrating Gruden said I think were better than that up front Were better than that at receiver dropping balls and were better than that at quarterback We all had our hand in it playcallers offensively it wasnt good enough obviously We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us Stephen Czarda 2 Ryan Kerrigan helped swing some momentum in the Redskins favor during the second quarter with the third picksix of his career Scoring the teams first points of the game in the second quarter Kerrigan caught Carson Wentzs pass intended for running back Darren Sproles and ran it into the end zone for a 24yard touchdown Well I got an assist from Stacy McGee there made it a little easier on me to make the catch Kerrigan said But I just had my coverage responsibility expanded with him and fortunately found the ball in my hands The picksix marks the linebackers third career interception all of which have been returned for touchdowns Kerrigan also contributed to one of the teams two sacks of Wentz who posed a challenge for the Redskins defense Clearly hes a tough guy to get down Kerrigan said I mean hes big hes athletic and we had a couple chances today where we had him wrapped up and he was able to escape like on the very first drive of the game when he launched that ball to Nelson Agholar and they scored a touchdown so I think you just got to wrap him up you got to wrap and hold on and wait for the posse to come Despite the teams overall challenges Kerrigan believes that the Washingtons defense forged a fair effort against Wentz and the Eagles offense I think by and large we played pretty well defensively a couple turnovers and we scored Alyssa Haduck 3 The defense showed glimpses of a more aggressive approach under Greg Manusky but were frustrated by the inability to bottle up Carson Wentz Throughout the offseason the defense remained open about its desire to be in more of an attacking mode under Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator after a year as the teams outside linebackers coach That was on display early as Josh Norman nearly had a diving interception on the units first play of the game before Preston Smith recorded a sack one snap later Then on third down it looked like the Redskins were going to get another sack from Jonathan Allen but Wentz slipped out of the rookies tackle attempt before extending the play just long enough to toss up a 50yard touchdown bomb It was one of a handful of plays in which the Redskins payed for not taking down the secondyear quarterback He made some good plays out there and really helped his team in tight spots said linebacker Mason Foster Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays We were right there We will go look at it and get it corrected and just keep getting better and try to make this the last one like that Wentz finished the day completing 26of39 passes for 307 yards with two touchdowns to one interception If you dont take him down when you get your hands on him he is going to make plays down the field said cornerback Bashaud Breeland He keeps his eyes down the field Stephen Czarda 4 In a backandforth contest the Redskins struggled to maintain possession of the ball and it cost them An aggressive Eagles defense made it difficult for the Redskins offense to produce on their possessions Early in the fourth quarter an interception at the goal line on third down robbed the Redskins of a chance to score in a game in which they were only trailing 1917 On a third down throw inside the 15yard line Cousins soared a pass over the head of Jamison Crowder The Eagles would intercept the ball and end any chance of the Redskins taking back the lead at that point I mean its anytime youre in the red zone and its third down youre going to expect some kind of allout zerocover blitz and thats what they gave us and we didnt handle it very well Gruden said But anytime youre down there youre going to protect the football Youve got to be safe with the ball That was a good rush but I think the ball just sailed on him by a hair unfortunately With less than two minutes left in the game Cousins was sacked and lost control of the ball Officials ruled the play a fumble allowing Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox to recover the ball and carry it into the end zone We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Gruden said Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us The Redskins will take note of the weaknesses in Sundays performance and look to adjust and improve for this weeks road game against the Los Angeles Rams Alyssa Haduck 5 The Redskins understand that they wont get the results they want on offense if theyre not balanced Prior to Sundays game Gruden noted in one of his press conferences last week that the offense will only be at its best when theyre balancing the number of passing and running plays But against the Eagles nearly 60 percent of Washingtons offensive plays were throws by Cousins Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson combined for just 13 caries while Cousins extended four passing plays into scrambles out of the pocket as the quarterback finished the day with four carries for 30 yards In total the Redskins managed just 60 rushing yards on 17 carries Our offense is always going to hum along at a much more efficient rate when were running the ball well and we can keep the defenses unaware if its going to be a run pass or a play action Cousins said If you can honor the run then you can hopefully open up some windows in the pass game I wouldve loved to run the ball better but theres also situations in the game too that you feel like youre throwing it well or youre getting third and long and not able to run it But if youre thirdandone youre going to get a lot more rushing attempts So sometimes its just situations that determine the play calling You get less attempts in practice with being able to run the ball Kelley said the entire offensive unit needs to execute better when they plan on running the ball Ten guys do something right and one guy does something wrong it messes up the play Kelley said Its just us being a team clinging on to each other knowing that we have each others back working together and executing Stephen Czarda',\n",

       " 3395: 'Sean McVays rise to become the youngest head coach in NFL history wouldnt have been possible without the Redskins or Jay Gruden Now Washington will face McVay in only his second game as Los Angeles head coach Kirk Cousins couldnt exactly believe at first that Sean McVay was one of the Washington Redskins coaches during his first few days in the NFL When Cousins was selected in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft the former Michigan State product was just months away from his 24 th birthday McVay meanwhile was a 26yearold entering his second season as the Redskins tight ends coach But the two were sharing a football field at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va that spring as one was trying to pick up an NFL offense for the first time while the other was beginning an ascent up the professional coaching ranks I thought that was just unique because where I had come from at Michigan State which is all I had known at the time we didnt have coaches that were that young position coaches Cousins said We had Matt LaFleur we had Kyle Shanahan all those coaches were young at that time but they were all sharp You could see right away Sean as he coached the tight ends not only was he sharp but he knew his material inside and out There was a conviction when he taught it that what this guy is saying not only is correct but its going to help me become a better player Regardless of his age I think guys listen to him right away and people who were older than him were willing to be coached by him because they respected his knowledge for the game and his desire for them to succeed Despite being younger than some of the players he was coaching McVay clearly had a coaching pedigree that was bound for success In his first season as Washingtons tight ends coach in 2011 McVay guided former secondround pick Fred Davis to the best season of his career as he posted career highs in receptions 59 and receiving yards 796 Two years later McVay was tasked with getting the most out of a thenrookie by the name of Jordan Reed In just nine games Reed recorded 45 receptions for 499 yards and three touchdowns both franchise records by a rookie tight end In a victory over the Chicago Bears Reed also recorded Redskins rookie tight end records in singlegame receptions nine and receiving yards 134 The record was previously held by Jerry Smith who registered just 78 receiving yards on six catches vs Dallas on Nov 28 1965 After the Redskins hired Jay Gruden to be 29 th head coach in franchise history on Jan 9 2014 McVay was appointed the teams offensive coordinator at the ripe age of 28 The two have longterm ties far before their time together roaming the sidelines for the Redskins Grudens father Jim was a scout for the San Francisco 49ers when McVays grandfather John was the teams general manager Jim Gruden also coached McVays father Tim while he was a player at Indiana The bond between the two families continued in Tampa first in 2008 with the Buccaneers and then again one season later with the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League So even though McVay was young Gruden felt comfortable handing over some of the offensive duties to him When I first got the job in Washington I didnt want to just totally change the entire system Gruden said Some of the terminology in place here in the running game and some of the playaction passes and keepers and all that stuff So the dropback game we tried to implement from what Ive known from over the past with my brother and in Cincinnati and Sean has a great idea of that also because he was with us in Tampa Bay for a year and he was also with me in the UFL for one year So I felt like just from talking to the quarterbacks instead of me having to tell him what the call to the quarterback and so forth it was quicker to let him do it We came up with the game plans together and situational type football we came up together and then I still had a little bit of input but I let him handle it because he was good and did a fine job McVay of course served as Washingtons offensive coordinator for three seasons 201416 Last year Washingtons offense became the first unit in franchise history to average more than 400 yards per game 4034 and notched a franchise record 6545 total net yards They also had three Pro Bowlers on offense as Trent Williams earned his fifthconsecutive nod while Cousins and guard Brandon Scherff received their first selections The Redskins also had eight players finish the season with at least 500 yards from scrimmage DeSean Jackson Pierre Garcon Jamison Crowder Rob Kelley Chris Thompson Jordan Reed Vernon Davis and Matt Jones tying the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most in a single season in NFL history In early January McVay interviewed with both the Rams and San Francisco 49ers While most though McVay was just getting his feet wet in being a head coach candidate Los Angeles thought otherwise On Jan 12 2017 McVay became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when the Rams named him the 23 rd fulltime head coach in their franchise history I wasnt shocked said Williams who was drafted by the Redskins the same year McVay joined the coaching staff I mean you sit down and talk to him and hes knows football inside and out So its not a position its not a scheme that he doesnt know I mean he can sit up there in the box or on the sideline and basically tell you whats happening whats going to happen and why it happened And in this game many times somebody that has that type of knowledge of the game theyre going to be highly sought after His impact on Washingtons offense was undeniable Cousins even signed a jersey for McVay and left a heartfelt message about his impact It just said and theres a lot of people I could say this to but certainly to him I just said I owe you my career and then signed it Cousins said I certainly appreciate the hard work he gave to our team and as a result gave me an opportunity to be successful and it was just a smart hire by Jay to bring him in in the first place at his age Very smart by Jay to give him the role that he gave him and the opportunities he gave him and you know thats one of Jays strengths his ability to identify potential in people and believe in them maybe when its not the common thought everywhere else Its not an obvious choice Jay clearly made a really good decision there in bringing in Sean and Sean proved him right and as a result hes a head coach now So I guess when you make good decisions like that and have success you could lose those people but Seans certainly a great coach To this day even though McVay is now more than 2500 miles from the Washington DC area he remains a fan of the Redskins outside of any time Washington and Los Angeles face off Gruden and McVay remain in touch on a frequent basis including after their games last Sunday but both have assured they arent giving away any sort of competitive advantage Nobodys a bigger Redskins fan every other week than I am just because what some of those people in that organization have done for me and how theyve treated me McVay said Cant say enough about Jay Gruden and just really the mentor hes been for me This week marks the first time Gruden and McVay will face off as opposing head coaches after the latter made a successful debut last Sunday The Rams easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 469 in a historic day for Los Angeles Despite Grudens familiarity with McVay Washingtons head coach knows schematically his counterpart will find ways to keep the Redskins on their toes Gruden said hes been spending a little bit more time with his defensive staff this week in preparation for McVays offense Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations a lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of stacks and theyve got a good running game with Todd Gurley and he changes it up with good playaction passes Gruden said I can tell them what he likes but stopping it is another issue because you stop certain things but then they hit you with the running game or they hit you with the playpass or hit you with the bunchstack deal and the quick game and its a great changeup We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel Cousins added It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly In this league that tends to happen weektoweek or yeartoyear as people change and move Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Washingtons defense will face the 2016 No

on a swivel and play our assignments and our keys said cornerback Josh Norman Understand what they like they to do against us because offense was here and now its there Jay runs similar things and weve just got to understand that and know what they like to do and try to take that away from them Because what you see is what youre going to get Mike linebacker Mason Foster knows that the unit must be at its best or McVays offensive genius will strike early and often He can find different ways to get the matchups that he likes and thats what he did here Foster said Even when I first got here and I was playing on the scout team When I first got picked up he was always asking me about different defenses Ive played in Hes a great coach and you see why he got that job At the end of the day its the Washington Redskins vs the LA Rams and its going to be a good one Its going to be cool to see Sean it was great to see somebody that came from here doing big things but at the end of the day were

       " 3402: 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Executing plays will overcome the familiarity that head coach Sean McVay has with the Redskins offense Eight months ago Rams head coach Sean McVay was still the Redskins offensive coordinator which is to say that hes still quite familiar with the kind of offense that Washington will be using when the team visits Los Angeles this weekend For quarterback Kirk Cousins that can have its drawbacks but it ultimately wont matter too much so long as the Redskins execute like they know they can on Sunday I think Sean McVay would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Although Cousins wasnt happy with his play on Sunday theres likely nothing McVay could have told him differently that head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh havent already discussed Its all correctable Cousins said Its all there to be fixed and its disappointing that we let one get away at home but theres nothing we can do to change it now We can only move forward and try to make the most of each opportunity we have and in preparing for the next opportunity Weve got a great challenge coming on Sunday and we can get right back where we want to be with a great performance and a win so thats where our focus is 2 McVay has meant a lot to Cousinss career and has always believed in him Before McVay left for the Rams Cousins signed a jersey for him and wrote I owe you my career on it Cousins said Wednesday there are a number of people to whom he could write that message but that McVay has never wavered in his trust of him Cousins an avid reader is currently reading Bill Walshs book and cited a passage about the former football coach who says the four most powerful words from a coach to a player are I believe in you Its the same kind of approach McVay took with Cousins working with him through the high and low parts of his career Sean said that to me over and over and over again even when there werent many other people who did so that certainly means a lot Cousins said Especially when you look back and see where we came from there Cousins elaborated on why he feels so strongly about McVay and the impact on him over the last several years Well I mean he was our play caller for my two best seasons in the league he said Im not telling you anything you dont already know I think its pretty selfevident why hes had a big impact on my careerSean has presence and its hard to teach presence He has charisma Thats hard to teach and its hard to teach being a good communicator You kind of either have it or you dont So you can talk about his age but he had presence when he was 20 years old and theres a lot of guys who are 65 who dont have any presence 3 The reads Cousins makes based on the defense are more important than the personnel around him Much was made about the amount of snaps certain offensive players received Sunday against the Eagles and how the ball was to be distributed to them This is not particularly a concern for Cousins who makes decisions about throwing the football based primarily on the defensive looks hes receiving on each play as he comes under center When they draw up the game plan they can create formations and motions and reads where certain guys may have a higher percentage chance of getting the football Cousins said But once it comes to game day unless its a complete 5050 read Im just going off what the coverage dictates and the front and what the read tells me to do and then from there what the postsnap read tells me to do It can be everybody on any given day and from week to week I think it will change quite a bit 4 Aaron Donalds return means it will be another tough task for the offensive line The Rams defensive line is considered one of the best in the NFL and it will receive a credible boost when Aaron Donald returns to the team this week after sitting out the preseason over a contract dispute Cousins hasnt studied the interior lineman too much but knows exactly the kind of presence and push he brings to the Rams defense I think that he seems to have really good leverage Cousins said He seems to be a very compact player He seems to have really good getoff off the snap count Hes quicktwitch Hes sudden He uses leverage and power Football is a game of leverage and power and he knows how to use it and get every ounce of his power and drive where he needs it to create havoc in the backfield The Redskins offensive line struggled with the Eagles pass rush allowing four sacks and several hurries forcing Cousins into quicker throws and a cluttered pocket in which to work The line will have to take step up to neutralize a pass rush that created four sacks one hit and five hurries against the Colts I do feel that every week when you look at the NFL schedule you can name a player on the other side of the ball whos dominant whos a game changing player and Aarons no different Cousins said They have a couple others as well But thats the NFL and thats why this league is so tough and also so great is because theres just such a challenge every single week 5 Timing between himself and receivers is always a work in progress Cousins explained on Wednesday that timing isnt like checking a box It requires constant tuning especially when going up against dangerous pass rushes each week As he works with his receivers to gain more trust with them the timing between them will begin to tighten up You have to kind of see it before it happens and then trust it and let it go and believe that its going to happen the way it needs to once the ball is out of your hands Cousins said That takes time and work and thats why Ive said for a long time were a work in progress Specifically looking at last Sunday Cousins is encouraged because most of the mistakes that were made were correctible in his eyes If they werent then youd be sitting here pretty nervous Cousins said But I do feel like including myself that a lot of the stuff that we didnt do well enough can be fixed and corrected and need to be So weve just got to get back out keep working never lose confidence and just prepare for the next one',\n",

offense was 3of11 27 percent on third downs while the defense allowed the Eagles to convert on more than half of their tries 8of14 Washingtons defensive unit actually was stout in short distances on third downs as they held Philadelphia to just 2of4 on third down attempts with five yards or less needed to move the chains But the Redskins allowed the Eagles to convert on half of their attempts of 3 rd and8 or greater yardage On the Eagles first third down of the game it looked like the Redskins were going to force a threeandout But two near sacks werent enough to take down Carson Wentz who launched a 58yard touchdown bomb on 3 rd and12 To stop such plays the Redskins need to get home and finish their plays especially with the quarterback in their grasp Rushing the passer Got to rush the passer said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden You can play different coverages theres going to be a hole in a zone if you play zone mantoman youre going to have to buckle down and play good tight mantoman At the end of the day youve got to rush the passer You cant give the quarterback time to throw and set his feet that easily like we did Its easy for pro quarterbacks to pick you apart and find an open receiver if they have time Offensively the Redskins cant make the same mistakes they did last week on third downs if they want to score their first victory of the season The unit was 0of2 inside the red zone and a critical third down interception by Kirk Cousins took points off the board We have to do a lot of things better Gruden said We have to protect better We have to throw the ball better We have to run better routes So it is just a combination of things I have got to call better plays I have to call plays that are conducive to those situations and the coverages that we are going to see by percentage and then we have to protect So a little bit of everything Stephen Czarda BE ON YOUR TOES AGAINST AN OLD FOE Redskins head coach Jay Gruden is on a collision course with his former offensive coordinator Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay and Gruden will partake in a game of minds during Sundays matchup at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Gruden and McVay both offensive minded coaches face the unique challenge of balancing both familiar schemes while also incorporating ones their opponent has never seen We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly Gruden said Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Cousins on the other hand said he was more focused on the Rams players on the field rather than the coaches on the sideline According to him thats where the real battle will be on the turf I think Sean would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Cousins had his best year in McVays offense in 2016 throwing for 4917 yards and 25 touchdowns McVays impact can already be seen in Los Angeles where second year

still maintains an impressive set of tools argues Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a big threat He is still a good running back Gruden said this week He has great vision good sight lines He has got burst through the hole He is a good back Gurley kicked off his 2017 season with a soso performance last week against the Colts He struggled for the most part in the running game rushing for just 40 yards on 19 attempts but found the end zone once While he was unable to get much of anything going on the ground quarterback Jared Goff completed five passes to Gurley for 56 yards It was somewhat of an underwhelming performance as a rusher for Gurley but Gruden noted that he had a couple runs that were called back due to penalty Still in an offense that has a multitude of young and new faces Gurley remains a focal point Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations Gruden said A lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a

       " 4204: 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 2 game against the Los Angeles Rams that took place at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 1 After a week in which the Redskins struggled to run the ball Washington breaks out with more than 200 yards on the ground In Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Redskins running backs accounted for just 34 rushing yards It was a different story on Sunday against a vaunted Los Angeles defense as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for 229 rushing yards All three running backs collected at least 65 yards on the ground marking the first time that has happened for the Redskins since the 1957 I think we just came out with the mindset we were going to run the ball enough so we did said Kelley who finished with 78 rushing yards on just 12 carries before being removed from the game with a rib injury I think we also run the ball I think he first couple plays we showed up and we were actually running it so coach stuck with it In the second quarter Thompson broke the game open with two touchdown runs On the first play of the quarter Thompson benefitted from setup blocks from Trent Williams and Terrelle Pryor Sr to take a pitch seven yards to the house Then just a few minutes later the shifty running back showed off his moves weaving in and out of the Rams defense for a 61yard score Thompson said the play was something the Redskins saw the Steelers use Weve seen LeVeon Bell he does it a lot Thompson said Its one of those plays where he has the option to run through a lot of different gaps and we thought we could possible get that going this week The Oline they did a great job and its all credit to them because they did such a good job at blocking Perine finished off the strong ground game performance on Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive as the rookie collected 38 rushing yards before Kirk Cousins found Ryan Grant for an 11yard touchdown I like the way he ran said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a tough physical guy like we thought 2 Ryan Grant comes through with the biggest moment of his career to date Opportunities Thats been the buzzword with the Redskins coaching staff when it comes to the fourthyear veteran In his first three seasons in Washington Grant was hidden on the depth chart behind the likes of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon But with the two veterans off the roster Grant has finally been given the opportunity to produce While the Tulane product was quiet for most of the day he hauled in the gamewinning score with less than two minutes left On 3 rd and5 from the 11yard line Grant lined up in a bunch formation on Cousins left After a slight delay off the line Grant ran out to his left before Cousins found him on the side of the end zone for a score It felt good man Grant said Everyones happy and our goal was to come in here and get the win and thats what we did As Washington seeks to get the passing game back on track after two quiet performances to start the season Cousins hopes to get Grant involved more He continues to show up on our practice film being wide open running really good routes Cousins said Ill work a go ball on the left and I can pick either side and Ryan is running by his defender on the other side It was great to get him a touchdown today Weve got to continue to get him involved and get him opportunities because hell prove his strength 3 A dislocated shoulder didnt stop Mason Foster from slamming the door shut on the Rams Even though Grants touchdown put the Redskins ahead with less than two minutes left Los Angeles still had time to piece together a potential gametying touchdown drive But Foster who had suffered a dislocated shoulder in the third quarter jumped a route intended for Cooper Kupp on Los Angeles first offensive play following the touchdown They had widened the stack out a little bit so I felt like earlier in the game I barely missed one and I told Kendall Fuller and Zach Brown next time we see it Im just going to go play it Im going to go jump it and it just so happens that the time that we saw it again was when we needed it the most Foster said But it was something that the coaches had alerted all week something that everybody talked about I just happened to be the one to make the play So its a great team win Foster has been impressive in the role of starting Mike linebacker for the Redskins this season Along with his gamesealing interception Foster also had six tackles and a pass defensed But the pick his first in three seasons with the Redskins capped off Washingtons lategame heroics I think he was waiting on that play the whole day said DJ Swearinger The linebackers were waiting on it the safeties the corners and we finally got it at the end of the game and he did what he was supposed to do to it Thats a great play by him and a great team win 4 The Redskins showed resiliency in the face of adversity Early on it looked as if the Redskins were going to easily handle the Rams Washington jumped out to a 100 lead and were primed to extend that lead to 170 after a Todd Gurley fumble But a drive that started at the Los Angeles 30yard stalled out with two incompletions on fade routes Still Dustin Hopkins was able to extend the lead to 130 But the Rams would fight back and score 10 unanswered points in the second half to knot the game at 20 apiece Between the gamewinning touchdown drive and Fosters interception though the Redskins did not break I think the guys just coming out here and battling four quarters and not threeandahalf said Josh Norman We did our job today and we executed Offensive line youve got to tip your hats off to those guys they are awesome There were role models today they did everything Give our running backs the rock they plow away and thats what you need from an offense like that Thompson was also pleased with how the Redskins fought back especially after a third quarter in which the offense was shut down In that third quarter our offense we couldnt get anything going and our defense continued to fight Thompson said They continued to help us stay in the game and they got us the ball back later in the game and we just made some plays I love this group Theres just something different with this group of guys that we have this year Were a lot closer everybodys like brothers out there You want to do things to not let your brothers down We made the necessary plays 5 As the offense still tries to seek an identity Cousins thinks the passing game will improve as time goes on Last season of course the Redskins were one of the best passing teams in the NFL Cousins nearly passed for 5000 yards while three different receivers posted at least 800 yards Through two games this year though the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific Through Sundays action Cousins ranks 16 th in passing yards 419 with just two touchdown passes In Sundays victory Cousins passes for just 179 yards with the late touchdown throw to Grant It was productive enough to get past the Rams but Cousins remains high on the potential of the passing attacks abilities I think were optimistic that right away we were going to be able to operate out of the gate Cousins said But when youre going against your own defense day after day after day it doesnt necessarily give you a great picture of what the real thing is going to look like against different teams every single week Were going to figure out an identity as we go and see what we do well Weve got to figure it out the sooner the better',\n",

       " 4521: 'In Los Angeles everyone is a star Denzel Washington Situated just south of the Hollywood Hills Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum attracted its fair share of Redskins fans last Sunday They had the thrill of seeing their team pick up its first victory of the season in thrilling fashion against the Rams scoring a goahead touchdown and intercepting a pass to seal the game in the final minutes It was another example of the Redskins resiliency coming up big on the road in a game that felt necessary to win These road games provide unique traveling experiences ones that occur at least eight times each season which are nothing new but are rarely documented When does a team get to its predetermined location How do players approach each part of their journeys What seat on the plane do they prefer Wide receiver Jamison Crowder is in his third season and has experienced his fair share of road trips Here he takes you through his itinerary and mindset during the Redskins first trip of the regular season last weekend 1 230 pm Friday Team bus departs Inova Sports Performance Center For Crowder preparation is key Before he boards the bus he wants to make sure he has everything ready to go before the long flight ahead My headphones making sure my phone is charged just trying to make sure to get the little stuff taken care of he says Im just thinking about the game and things about what I need to do to be influential in the game while Im on the flight Crowder says 2 300 pm Friday Board plane at Dulles International Airport As the season progresses and it gets a little colder Crowder will opt for a blazer But on a relatively warm day and nearly five hours of sitting inside a plane awaiting him Crowders priority is feeling comfortable Thats why he goes with just a shirt as he walks up the plane steps I wanted to look as presentable as possible without wearing a suit because I knew the flight was going to be long he says I wanted to feel comfortable So I made sure that was one of the things that I kept in mind was that to wear a nice shirt nice jeans nice pair of dress shoes and still be comfortable I made sure that I tried to look as clean as possible 3 315 pm Friday On the plane Crowder is assigned a window seat which suits him just fine He starts off the trip with some music Obviously Im a big J Cole fan so I listened to some of his albums some of his mixtapes and then decides to watch the movie Hidden Figures About midway through I ended up falling asleep so Im going to have to go back and watch the end because I dont know what happened But it seemed like a pretty good movie up to the point that I didnt watch Crowder says Im definitely going to have to finish that Once I woke up I probably had another hourandahalf or so until we landed I just put back on my music for the time being and that was pretty much it Once we got to the West Coast once we got closer over there I turned on some Kendrick Lamar I was trying to get into my West Coast vibes 4 615 pm Friday Arrive at hotel Marina Del Ray Calif For dinner that night Crowder heads out to Santa Monica with fellow wide receiver Josh Doctson whose favorite restaurant is Del Friscos Thats definitely his favorite Crowder says I mean its alright I like it its pretty good but thats definitely Doctsons favorite restaurant After dinner both of them walk over to the Santa Monica pier where they meet up with wide receiver Brian Quick We chilled out there for a little bit and then just went back to the hotel after that he says I just laid down and stayed in the room pretty much for the rest of the evening 5 100 pm Saturday Bus to UCLA for practice The work doesnt end on Saturday The team has its usual walkthrough practice scheduled but because theyre in a new city they must borrow a practice field This time UCLA comes to the rescue offering up their facility for the team to get in sync one last time before Sundays game They had a really nice facility from the little bit that we saw Crowder says I think that whole bus ride there from the hotel to the facility was pretty cool because you get a chance to kind of see the difference get views of the different landscapes of LA Me being from the south and being used to more land and more open areas seeing LA and all the houses and stuff right close together and all the palm trees and all that kind of stuff it was a cool bus ride from the hotel to the practice field Once I got there UCLA has a really nice facility and it was pretty cool 6 230 pm Saturday Return to hotel After the team returns from walkthrough practice players have their options to find dinner and prepare for the game ahead Crowder meets up with a friend who worked in Los Angeles and the two walk down the street to grab some dinner and talk for some more in the hotel lobby Then its time to relax For the most part on Saturday I just try to chill out and stay off my feet as much as possible and really just do the things I need to do to get my body ready for the game he says Whatever hotel were in I make sure I have my bag of epsom salts and always run me a warm bath just to kind of loosen up my muscles and everything the night before 7 915 am Sunday Board bus to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Better rested than the previous night and with the jet lag not as strong some players rise early and head to the buses parked outside the hotel Now is the time for focus to go over everything that has been covered and practiced during the week Im just thinking about the game Crowder says of his mindset on the bus Just trying to let the game play in my mind just trying to pump myself up making sure that Im on the details of whatever plays notes that Im going through from over the week from practice just a last checkup to make sure Im good Other than that its just go out there and make plays have fun dont get to caught up into it At the end of the day its a game Its a job but its a game so go out there and have fun and make plays 8 125 pm Sunday Game begins vs Los Angeles Rams The Redskins defeat the Rams 2720 to collect their first victory of the season Crowder grabs four passes for 47 yards picking up a key first down on the final gamewinning drive of the day The experience of playing in the Coliseum is notable for a variety of reasons We were warming up out there and I was actually thinking about the movie Money Talks a movie with Chris Tucker Crowder says At the end of the movie Chris Tucker took this French guys diamonds and had them hidden at the Coliseum Theres a part in the movie towards the end I kind of laughed to myself Chris Tucker grabs the diamonds and yells to the French guy Is this what you want So he takes the diamonds and just tosses them and throws them down the Coliseum steps You have to see the movie So I was thinking about that But it was cool playing there for the first time and I was just glad we could get the win 9 625 pm Sunday Board plane at LAX After changing back into their casual clothes players walk up the Coliseum tunnel board the buses and depart for the airport Awaiting them is another fourhourplus flight home but this one will be much sweeter Its definitely better when you win Its not as bad he says I knew it was a long flight Like I said I made sure that I had my headphones my phone charged up put back on my music I ended up taking a nap and fell asleep for much of the flight It was uncomfortable but I stayed asleep I didnt even watch a movie this time I played a little bit of solitaire By the time I woke up we were getting ready to land So the flight was a little easier coming back after the win Another road trip in the books',\n",

       " 4540: 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda answers YOUR questions submitted on Twitter about the Redskins roster and more as the team prepares for a Week 3 matchup with the Raiders at FedExField NPHarris 4 asks What is the defensive plan for stopping Oaklands running game HailMail Once again the Redskins will face another one of the leagues toughest running backs in the form of fivetime Pro Bowler Marshawn Lynch Despite spending the 2016 season in retirement Lynch appears to have not missed a beat so far in his first year with Oakland In two games so far this year Lynch has carried the ball 30 times for 121 yards and one touchdown In a blowout victory over the New York Jets last Sunday Lynchs workload was light He carried the ball only 12 times on just 23 offensive plays After struggling to slow down opposing running games last year Washington has shown growth in that category this season Yes Todd Gurley was able to rush for 88 yards last week but Washington is currently ninth against the run so far this year allowing just 75 rushing yards per contest One key to the teams early success stopping the run has been their ability to wreak havoc without giving up big plays The Redskins are one of just two teams in the NFL right now to have forced three fumbles without giving up a 20yard run The goal this week will be to remain aggressive against Beast Mode and an Oakland rushing attack that also includes Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington We might give up a run here and there but at the end of the day were going to come after you were going to tackle you said Redskins linebacker Zach Brown It doesnt matter who you are because some of us have already played against Marshawn when he was with the Seahawks So for us it was the same guy that was at the Seahawks but you know hes just got a better Oline So when we hit him we just have to make sure we keep driving our feet John G asks Hopkins has now missed 2 field goals in two games Should we be worried HailMail Yes Hopkins missed a 51yard field goal attempt in last Sundays victory over the Los Angeles Rams when he had enough power to hit the lengthy attempt but clanked it off one of the uprights but the 26yearold remains one of the best players at his position today It is one of the main reasons why Washington didnt bring in any kicking competition for Hopkins during the offseason I think hes a young kid and I think hes worth having here said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden last month I dont think we really need to bring in a lot of competition but we have a list of players to bring in if they struggle just like everybody else at every other position But I have total confidence that the specialists wont struggle and theyre going to be a great weapon for us Hop can bang it Between Washingtons four preseason and two regular season games this year Hopkins is 10of12 on his field goal attempts and a perfect 10of10 on extra point tries He has also had six of his kickoffs downed for touchdowns tied for the 11 th best mark through two weeks Field goals of 50plus yards are far from automatic as last Sunday proved for Hopkins But he has shown the past that he can kicks from that distance While Hopkins started strong before dealing with some inconsistencies midway through last season the Redskins remain high on the fourthyear Florida State product DorianB asks How much Samaje should we expect with Kelley being Day to day This will be something that well have to monitor as the week progresses Kelley as you mentioned is currently daytoday as he deals with a rib injury suffered in the second quarter of Washingtons victory over the Rams Hell have three days of practices to test the injury but if he cant play on Sunday the team will likely look to rookie Samaje Perine as the featured back with Chris Thompson and Mack Brown serving their own roles After not playing offensive snaps in Washingtons regular season opener against the Eagles Perine appeared on 26 plays against Los Angeles defense The Oklahoma product got off to a bit of a slow start as he had just 12 yards on his first five carries But as the game wore on Perine started to get into a groove On Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive late in the fourth quarter the 5foot11 236 pounder carried the ball seven times for 38 yards I think I felt him run with a lot of power Gruden said Even after his 10 th 12 th 15 th carry I still think he had power left in the tank which was good to see A lot of times you dont know how their stamina is going to be when they get more than 1012 carries but I think his stamina was outstanding and he ran with great pad level and got the tough physical yards we needed Some have wondered if it should be Thompson as the feature back if Kelley is sidelined especially with his redhot start to this season But Gruden doesnt want to expand Thompsons role too much Chris has got such a defined role for this offense and it could be expanded but hes so important to us on third down we just have to be careful Gruden said Hes not the biggest guy in the world We dont want him to get 2025 carries a game and get a lot of pounding on that body Hes definitely needed in pass protection and the routes and all that stuff on third down and red zone So well try to expand his role a little bit but we dont want to go too crazy with him',\n",

       " 4629: 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 He loves the versatility Chris Thompson brings Its no question the Redskins offense has benefited greatly from running back Chris Thompsons play through two games this season The thirddown back whose role may increase more depending on the health status of starter Rob Kelley has scored three of the teams four offensive touchdowns thus far increasing his playmaking while continuing to be a supreme passblocker The quickspark ability has made it easier on quarterback Kirk Cousins whose load has been lightened by Thompsons versatility The Florida State product has gained 81 yards both rushing and receiving providing a changeup from the more punishing running style of Kelley and Samaje Perine Cousins ran off a laundry list of the things Thompson does well He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Cousins said There is just a lot to like and the other thing about Chris that you have to know from his story is it wasnt like he showed up as a rookie and was an AllPro It took time to develop and thats the case with so many guys in this league He has got a great demeanor about him Cousins added He is very composed very intelligent good teammate I told him that I said Youre the kind of guy I want in the huddle in a tense moment in an away stadium just because you feel like he is a guy who has composure about him and the moment is not too big for him So cant say enough good things about Chris and hopefully continue to lean on him I think we will continue to lean on him because of the mismatches he can create on linebackers and things like that 2 Thompsons conscientious mentality is an example of the strong locker room the team has The Thompson love continued when Cousins was asked about how Thompson felt bad that he couldnt collect a pass in the Rams game that could have potentially gone for another long score Thompson lamented the fact that the catch would have likely given Cousins more than 200 yards passing It was another small example of a player thinking about his teammate Ive said it many times and hopefully it translates to wins I dont know that it always does but we do have a really good locker room Cousins said It is examples like that where players are thinking of other players that makes a big difference The second the ball left my hand and we didnt complete it I said to myself I threw it too hard I didnt give him a chance to really catch it I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward 3 With more reps hell have more opportunities to find Josh Doctson in the passing game A few times during Sundays game against the Rams wide receiver Josh Doctson slipped out of coverage and had an opportunity for a big pass play but Cousins didnt look his way That was due to a variety of things reading the defense differently having pressure in his face reasons why the two havent connected so far in the regular season That figures to change eventually and Doctsons full participation at practice Wednesday and presumably for the entire week should help get them on a better rapport come Sunday night against the Raiders Every play is different but you always have your reads and where your eyes are and you focus downfield and you try to feel the pass rush Cousins said There are times where you stand in there and make the throw which I have done many times There is times where you eat it and you take the sack to avoid a tipped ball or an interception or whatever it may be Theres times where you have enough time to throw the ball the way to avoid the sack but you also knew that the read downfield wasnt declaring and so rather than throwing it into a gray window you just throw the ball away Those are those splitsecond decisions that you try to train through muscle memory with a lot of practice reps and game reps Thats something that I think I am continuing to get better and better at 4 He respects Oaklands football culture and its premier defenders The first attribute that impressed Cousins about the teams next opponent the Raiders was their culture change over the last couple of years with quarterback Derek Carr under center Then he turned to their defense specifically defensive end Khalil Mack and linebacker Bruce Irvin who hes faced before when playing against Seattle Khalil Mack is as good as they come in the NFL and Bruce Irvin Ive played against when he was in Seattle and hes a very active player both in the pass game and in the run game Cousins said Very athletic in space Obviously we know David Amerson and the player that hes become Theyve got experienced players they had a great year and went to the playoffs last year for a reason and theyre 20 for a reason Very good defense Head coach Jay Gruden mentioned that Oakland mixes up its front seven really well making it challenging to know what kind of blitz packages are coming If the run game can sustain itself that should ease some of the pressure 5 Though the passing game hasnt quite clicked yet hes optimistic it will improve Cousins has thrown for just 419 yards in his first two regular season games putting him below pace from the past two years of prolific offense There are a variety of factors contributing to this slower start a dropped pass here a missed read there but Cousins remains confident that the pass offense will progress in the coming weeks especially if the run game can provide them more opportunities for playaction I would like to think that as the year goes on the offense gets better and better Cousins said Sometimes around this league I dont know I would be interested to do a study to see do offenses tend to take more time to get going than defenses in this league I wonder I know for me these last couple seasons weve gotten stronger as the year has gone on offensively and have gotten an identity and kind of gotten a better understanding of what we do well and how to make that work week in and week out Hopefully we take those steps going forward and we just hit our stride and play much better than we have the first two weeks But that being said we have still done some really good things the first two weeks and have moved the ball but I think there is more in the tank there that we have got to bring out',\n",

stay in the DCarea and what he aspires to do after his football life finishes Is there a better feeling on the field than grabbing a picksix I would say a picksix in a win would be the only better feeling Two of my picksixes have come in losses the first one came in a win It was definitely a lot easier to enjoy after the win than it was after the losses Its definitely exciting because you catch the ball you kind of realize youre in the open by the crowds reaction because theyre cheering they know youre going to score At that point its just pure joy I can imagine when youre touching the football its a weird experience It is a little bit especially when youre running with it Its one thing to dive on it in a pile and just cover it but to catch it and run the other way and score with it its a little nervewracking because youre like hows my ball security going to be if I do encounter someone that wants to tackle me and how do I defeat someone if theyre going to try and tackle me Its definitely weird for a defender to do it but its a great feeling nonetheless Youre a mildmannered guy off the field and the opposite on the field Is it strange when you think about that dichotomy If you actually sit down and think about it yeah You think like Ok I have to be really aggressive violent and try to destroy the guy Im going against on the field but off the field Im pretty quiet pretty reserved nonconfrontational Its pretty interesting when you think about it I guess you have to have that to live a balanced life Oh you have to have that You dont want to be both on both fields You dont want to be nice off the field and nice on the field You dont want to be mean on the field and mean off the field You got to find the balance I know its clich to flip the switch Was passrusher a position you always wanted to play Yeah ever since I started playing tackle in fifth grade I was a defensive lineman partially because I was too heavy to carry the ball Otherwise I might have tried to play quarterback or something else Ive been playing defensive line and rushing the quarterback pretty much my whole football life Is there a big difference for you when you go through a variety of linebackers coaches as you have in your career A little bit Anytime you have a switch in coaches its obviously a change but I mean I think you just try to absorb as much as you can from each coach because theyre all going to help you take your game to another level Your birthday was last month How did you celebrate My fiance went down to the city and we went to Bens Chili Bowl Thats my first time going to the U Street original Thats kind of my thing Anytime I get a free chance I want to go to the city and just experience something new in the city because theres so much to do here in DC Thats kind of my thing Some guys go to the country I head east Did you at least have a nice dinner though We went to Eddie Vs in Tysons for dinner So I got one halfsmoke at Bens for the experience and then went to Eddie Vs afterwards Do you have any pressure around birthdays to make it a big day Honestly my birthdays always been during training camp so its never really been a big celebration thing to where Im like Im going to do this Im going to go out its always been whatever day of the week it is for me Since Ive been with my fiance birthdays have always been a big thing for her so shes always made my birthdays a big deal and always has balloons and cooks for me Its definitely changed since shes come into the picture So are you a little spoiled The past few Ive definitely been spoiled Is that the biggest difference being engaged now Yes Im definitely more spoiled on my birthdays now Its a point of emphasis for her and she takes pride in making it a good birthday You also help run your bulldogs Instagram account Did you realize this was going to be a thing I really had no idea Whats really funny is well be walking around Reston Town Center with the dogs and well get stopped by someone thatll say We follow your dogs on Instagram I cant believe its them Its like What These people are fans of my dogs Did you set up the Instagram first No my fiance did She set it up Ill throw up a post every once in a while but shes the wizard with it gets the pictures all right Its crazy to see the following Theyre awesome dogs Do you have more fun posting about dogs or posting on your own account The posts on my dogs account are more frequent so Id say on my account if Im posting about something Im really feeling Ok I want to get this out there because I want to make my posts unique and not so frequent Whats the main reason you dont tweet as much as some of your teammates I dont know I get on Twitter all the time Im probably on Twitter as much as anybody I just never post anything I just like to see what other people post Honestly I dont really have a lot to say both in person and on Twitter I guess you can leave the posting to your fiance Yeah shes a more frequent poster than I am She probably does a better job of keeping people up to date with what Im doing outside of football than I do Thats one of the perks of being engaged I ask because I know its easy to get jealous or annoyed with people who post a lot Is that maybe a reason for your smaller presence Yeah I see people who post all the time and there might not be a lot of difference in what they post one day to the next Oh hey Im working out today Next day Oh hey Im working out Its like alright we get it you like to work out I dont want anybody to ever feel like all he posts about is his dogs or football I want to keep a little variety and not oversaturate it Do you struggle with comparing yourself to other people On social media or on the football field No I wouldnt say that Where does the competitive edge come from Are you good at motivating yourself Yeah definitely because I feel like I have a lot of abilities and I have a lot of talent and a lot of good fortune in my life So I feel like I owe it to myself and everyone around me to work hard and be the best I can be Have you allowed yourself to think about the next step after football Yeah you try to think about what you want to do how you want to stay busy how you want to contribute to society and Ive got some ideas in mind and you always want to be prepared to make the right step now so when youre done you can make a smooth transition Ive got some things in mind Do you care to share any of them I know youve expressed interest in wanting to be on camera I would like that especially in Washington DC theres so much opportunity for that Obviously getting to stay in the area would be a dream come true for me so something footballrelated Ill have to do something footballrelated whether its coaching at one level or another high school college pro or doing something mediarelated I feel like it would have to be football or sportsrelated because Im too much of a sports guy to do something completely different Ive been told Big Ten network is a big love of yours I mean the BTN is you heard right Is that just the Purdue connection I guess I just associate the Big Ten network with falls in Big Ten country across the Midwest I had a lot of fond memories growing up in that time and playing college football in that area Thats probably where the fondness comes from Is it tough to stay present sometimes when you have ideas for the future and want to make connections throughout the year Id say its easy to stay present Its tough to think too far ahead in the future and try to do too much to prepare I still want to play football for a long time Thats my focus today and every day Whats something about Indiana most people dont know about I feel like in Indiana we have the hottest of the hot and the coldest of the cold weatherwise People always think that its this cold place but in the summertime it can get hot as hell there and its humid It can be in the high 90s low 100s but then in the winter it can be minus10 So its pretty unique in that theres so much variety And Indianapolis has those overhead walkways like Minneapolis because its so cold Right Another thing that weve got in Indiana is that people are so kind and friendly Midwest people are and I know the term salt of the earth get thrown around a lot but really its true Theyre good wholesome people and theyd give you the shirt off their back Do you think youd like to move back there or are you content to leave that as your childhood home I love it here now so if I could ultimately stay in the DC area that would be awesome Ive really grown to love the area Ill always love Indiana and everything about it But Im here now and hope to be for a long time Is there something in football that you feel is underreported Id say the daytoday making sure your body is ready to not only get ready for Sunday but get right for practice that day the amount of time you have to put in to get your body ready for practice and the different treatment youve got to do both here at the facility and then at home to make sure your body is ready for the game Because when we leave here we might be here for 1112 hours a day when we leave here the football doesnt really stop for a lot of us We go home and we watch film and we have to ice down what may be bothering us and do some stretching and whatnot Long story short all the extra stuff youve got to do Its not just practicing its not just watching film Its stretching after practice its foamrolling its watching film on your own making sure youre eating the right foods all the little things that are personal decisions that arent necessarily required by the coaching staff that really give a lot of guys an edge And thats something you take a lot of pride in Definitely Its not only something that helps me for each Sunday but it helps your body to feel better in general so that you can prolong your football career Speaking of which whats the shake youve been drinking as weve talked VegaOne Its a veganprotein plantbased protein Is this new This is new I did some bloodwork and found I had a wheyprotein intolerance so I started doing the plantbased So far so good So far so good It doesnt taste as good as whey but its a lot better for you so Ill take that Youre a fan favorite here Whats the strangest thing someones sent to you unsolicited Ive been invited to a number of peoples weddings The thing about that thats crazy to me is like it will be a really nice invitation so you can tell this is not just a wedding theyre throwing together in someones backyard This is like a really nice event Theyre inviting me and I dont know who they are But you have a place at their table To me thats like these people must really think a lot of me to invite me to their wedding If you have a free weekend and you had an invitation would you ever go to one You know what I want to I do want to one of these days because it would obviously mean something to them if theyre willing to invite me and if I were to show up Im sure it would mean something to them Maybe one day Ill do that Hopefully they can give me a plusone so my fiance can come I would think its risky because you might take all the attention away from the bride and groom Thats true You wouldnt want that And that would just be bad in general because Im not like the life of the party guy If Im the life of your party your party probably sucks Maybe you could just have a pen at the ready for autographs on the wedding line Yeah get out there for Shout and call it a day',\n",
       " 4746: 'Washingtons thirddown running back has dealt with a turbulent NFL career while overcoming his own self doubts Now he is thriving in his fourth year with the Redskins In the NFL change is inevitable Most of the time change comes at the benefit of player whether it be to maximize a certain skill or fill a need for the team Chris Thompson faced his fair share of change after leaving Florida State for the NFL Draft When he wasnt battling injuries while playing for the Seminoles Thompson was out on the field as much as possible However two seasonending injuries in his junior and senior years hurt his draft stock Once the Washington Redskins selected Thompson in the fifth round in 2013 it was clear his role in the game would soon change I think for me it was more mental than anything I had to learn over time It wasnt easy Thompson said Its something that I have to get used to but over time I started to get more and more comfortable Once I got comfortable with myself being in that role then I was able to execute better Thompsons new role includes being a primarily thirddown back in charge of giving the offense the extra push when it matters most along with returning kicks This new position came after years of being jostled around the roster going back and forth to the practice squad before finally signing an extension with the team in early September In Week 1 Thompson scored Washingtons only offensive touchdown of the game off a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins In Week 2 Thompsons role became paramount when fellow running back Rob Kelley went down with an injury during the third quarter While rookie Samaje Perine took most of the handoffs it was Thompson who put up the big numbers On just three carries he scored two touchdowns and amassed 77 yards He also made contributions in the passing game with three catches for 29 yards Chris is one of our best players and is a tremendous asset to our offense because he is so versatile Cousins said He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Thompsons day was not completely highlight filled however Some costly and avoidable mistakes kept him from turning in an almost spotless game Thompson failed to haul in what would have been a 60yard touchdown pass from Cousins early in the second half Im not going to lie to you on the plane ride getting dressed after the game this morning watching film when I was outside at practice I was thinking about that one play Thompson said My first thing I wanted to do when I got out there in individuals with the quarterbacks was to run that route again and catch the ball Thompson said one of the reasons he was bitter was that it kept Cousins from breaking 200 yards passing He said with that one catch he could have silenced those who question how balanced the Redskins offense is Cousins meanwhile said when a play falls through its never just one players fault I didnt give him a chance to really catch it Cousins said I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward Thompson said he often thinks this way after a costly mistake in a game He said it can be both a blessing and a curse always evaluating his game and trying to improve but sometimes spends too much time dwelling on his failures Yeah and people say that Im too hard on myself but thats just me Thats who I am Theres a lot of things I can go and look back on Thompson said Its something that as a human you have to let it go you have to move on but for me that motivates me to be better on the next play moving forward',\n",

one guy slips off someone is right there to make a tackle Its about team defense and its going to take all 11 guys to get to the ball Stephen Czarda CONTINUE THE BALANACED ATTACK Even though quarterback Kirk Cousins passed for nearly 5000 yards last season the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific so far this year After Cousins threw for just 240 yards and three touchdowns in an opening game loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Los Angeles Rams held the Pro Bowl quarterback to just 179 yards on 18 completions It was the fewest passing yards he had in a game since Week 17 of the 2015 season when he only played to the early minutes of the second quarter in a game one week after the Redskins clinched the NFC East While Washington certainly wants more production from Cousins the running game burst onto the scene last Sunday as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for more than 220 yards Facing an offense this week that can put up points in bunches a similar outing by the running backs could go a long way in getting the Redskins their first victory at FedExField this year Anytime you add balance into your offense it opens up all the different areas said tackle Trent Williams If you can run the ball it keeps the chains in manageable distance it opens up your playbook to a lot more options and plays that you can pick Gruden added that being multidimensional on offense is going to be important determining factor between wins and losses and the season wears on Attacking a Raiders defense that currently ranks 19 th against the run while getting the passing game clicking could keep Oakland off balance just enough to grab a victory The ability to run the ball is a great asset for us and its necessary for us to be successful longterm Gruden said For us to get to the playoffs and win Super Bowls we have to be balanced and we have to be able to run the ball to take the pressure off our quarterback and open up the play actions Stephen Czarda TURN THE CARR AROUND Coming into Week 3 Oaklands offense ranks fourth in the NFL in yards per game This no doubt is due to the so far flawless play of quarterback Derek Carr The fourthyear passer out of Fresno State has thrown five touchdowns this season with no interceptions In two games he has amassed 492 yards through the air and has only been sacked two times Gruden said thats where his team needs to excel getting to Carr before the ball leaves his hand It gets frustrating for pass rushers You know you say Rush the quarterback rush the quarterback and the balls gone at one point I think the average was under two seconds that he gets the ball out of his hands Gruden said Well get our hands up maybe bat some balls but still I think if you make the quarterback uncomfortable even if you dont get the sack it can be equally as important as getting the sack The Redskins defense who through two games has recorded four sacks will have its hands full trying to bring down the 6foot3 215pound Carr who sits behind a stellar offensive line and has plenty of talented receivers to dump the ball off to in no time Receiver Michael Crabtree for instance caught three touchdowns last week against the New York Jets Our defensive line and linebackers will be challenged Gruden said Theyre anxious Theyre excited It will be a great test Brandon Hill SHINE UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS FedExField will be at the forefront of the football world this weekend as the Redskins and Raiders do battle in 2017s third edition of Sunday Night Football Along with the Sunday Night game comes a national audience a primetime stage and an added sense of excitement for players and coaches alike Oh were excited head coach Jay Gruden said this week I think losing our opener home opener against Philadelphia hurt a little bit and were excited to get our next home game We know its going to be a great test For linebacker Mason Foster this is the type of game that he dreamed to

       " 4899: 'The Raiders were the team that brought Terrelle Pryor Sr into the NFL as he played quarterback for Oakland for a few seasons Now hes one of the Redskins starting wide receivers with a 1000yard receiving season under his belt Its a transition few have ever made and almost none have seen the same sort of early returns Terrelle Pryor Sr was best known as an Ohio StateturnedNFL quarterback who didnt quite pan out in the professional ranks Selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Supplemental Draft Pryor produced mediocre results in his two seasons as a quarterback for the Oakland Raiders Between the 201213 seasons Pryor completed 56 percent of his pass attempts with just nine touchdown passes to 12 interceptions With the Raiders in the market for a future franchise quarterback Pryor was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in April 2014 Despite offseason roster stints with the Seahawks Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns Pryor wouldnt appear in an NFL game again until Week 17 of the 2015 season as a wide receiver With his desire to continue playing football Pryor elected to make the switch to wide receiver It turned an NFL career in jeopardy into one of the best success stories of the 2016 season as Pryor totaled 77 receptions for 1007 yards and four touchdowns with the Browns He posted these numbers despite having almost no stability from Clevelands quarterback position Not many people have ever done it before but he is a big physical great athlete said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden And it helps to be 6foot5 and run a 43 40 yard dash I think had he made this decision sooner in his career I think hed be further along But being that he just made it not too long ago hes where he is I mean hes still one of the top guys in the league and he just started playing Hes a physical freak Indeed others who have gone from quarterback to wide receiver havent had 1000yard seasons like Pryor Former Redskins wide receiver Antwaan Randle El for example went from a college quarterback at Indiana to NFL wideout But he never posted more than 730 receiving yards in any of his nine professional seasons Most former quarterbacks you put them in a situation where now they are getting hit a lot more exposed a lot to a lot more situations in terms of the physical aspect of the game You think they tend to turn a lot of stuff down he doesnt do that said Redskins wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard He plays the game aggressively and hes made the transition well But the transition wasnt exactly as it looked on the field last year Pryor had to learn some of the simplest traits of the position let alone prepare for seasoned NFL defensive backs starring him down Tim Cortazzo my trainer he spent three four hours a day not just outside running routes but also going indoors running around cones because I really didnt know how to handle my body I didnt know how to adjust my body I didnt know how to take control of myself Pryor said Now Im at the point where I can control my body I know where Im going I know what I want to do to the defender I know how to stare at the guy in his eyes and make him think that Im doing something else and then try to do something else Thats what I continue to get better at stuff like that While hes now known as a wide receiver his background at the quarterback position hasnt gone to waste On the contrary hes benefitted from knowing what its like to be the one in charge of an offense I just like the fact that hes a very bright guy understands coverages understands where the ball should go and route concepts which is very big Gruden said He is a very smart receiver now its just about polishing up the little things and the details of each route and were working with him on that Polishing up the intricacies hasnt been perfect for Pryor as would be the case for any player making a change in their 20s after spending their entire upbringing at a different position Pryor was active on social media during the offseason showcasing his hard work posting almost daily his progress Some days of course were better than others But the 28yearold wanted to show people that his success last season was no fluke When you go and have an excellent season or do some great things people know why Pryor said of his workout videos on social media Little kids know why Maybe thatll get kids outside to work out more and work hard people that look up to me people that I inspire So I think thats another reason thats a little deeper for me Late in the offseason Pryor posted a series of workout videos that showed him both following and competing with AllPro Antonio Brown When I talk about a freak mind like a weirdo freak in terms of everything has to be perfect watching Antonio work out it just changed my whole mindset of how youre supposed to be as a wideout Pryor said Its just the little details I was telling you guys earlier hell do three four reps in a row and then hell take a break because that next rep he wants that to be 100 percent and he wants it to be perfect And thats all you want to do is chase perfection and thats what Im looking forward to and Im just going to continue to grow from that standpoint While his workout posts have decreased now that the season has arrived his mindset in terms of hard work pays off hasnt During the preseason Pryor would spend as much as 30 minutes after practice working with starting quarterback Kirk Cousins As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said last month We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time Cousins was appreciative of Pryors request to spend extra time together I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year',\n",

production over its first two games Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins was confident last week that the teams offense was on the brink of breaking out He mentioned the early dropped passes mistakes and hesitations that left the team regretful but optimistic that with the right corrections a big game was in store Eventually those mishaps would be cleaned up Sunday night on a national stage at FedExField Cousins and the Redskins offense confirmed his belief beating the Oakland Raiders 2710 and providing the blueprint for how each facet should operate in unison The attack looked clean efficient and had the flashes of brilliance that head coach Jay Gruden had been waiting to see erupt from his quarterback and stable of weapons In essence the Redskins made the plays they expected from themselves Cousins made smart decisions with the football completing 25of30 passes for 365 yards three touchdowns and no interceptions He distributed the ball to eight different receivers using a diversity of throws to connect on reliable short and screen passes and for the first time this season the deep ball He was also for the second consecutive game afforded a run game which tallied 116 yards to anchor his arm It was enough to pile up 472 total yards and a renewed confidence in Cousins and the talent around him against a strong Oakland defense You can look at the yards and say obviously I like the yards and the completion percentage but really I think there were some decisions that Kirk made that were equally as impressive not forcing the ball running the ball when we had a couple of bad looks protecting the football head coach Jay Gruden said We had a third down and five and he ran it we kicked a field goal to go up 17 he couldve forced it in there and made a bad decision I think he really managed the game perfectly He made some bigtime throws the receivers made some plays for him so all around I was very impressed with the entire offense moving the ball The scoring started early and provided a window into the rest of the nights crisp play Without tight end Jordan Reed in the lineup Vernon Davis stepped up to fill the void grabbing a 26yard pass over the middle beautifully placed into his outstretched hands to convert on the first third down which the Redskins handled 7of15 times Sunday night After several small gains from running back Samaje Perine Cousins then found Chris Thompson wide open to his left and the running back began another memorable night with a 22yard touchdown catch and run Thompson would figure mightily into the offensive production again he totaled 150 yards receiving and 38 yards rushing on the night as would Davis who caught Cousinss second touchdown pass a 19yard strike that hit him in stride to extend Washingtons lead in the second quarter Even with its numerous setbacks the majority of them drivekilling penalties the offense continued to play a complete game dominating in time of possession the Redskins racked more than 38 minutes compared to the Raiders 21 and feeding off the defenses continual quick stops As Thompson said our defense when they play that way it makes the offense play even harder Perine ran the ball for 49 yards and milked the clock throughout drives while Jamison Crowder Ryan Grant and Terrelle Pryor Sr all helped extending drives on third down The most noteworthy and electric strike came in the third quarter when Cousins lofted a deep pass down the right sideline to wide receiver Josh Doctson the teams firstround pick last year who was without a catch in this young season Using all of the physical tools he has been gifted Doctson leapt over Raiders cornerback David Amerson and grabbed the football in front of him forcing his way into the end zone after landing for a 52yard touchdown the first of his career Any time you start fast you know its up and down plays happen you can easily give the ball back quarterback Kirk Cousins said You can have a bad decision here or there and miss the read The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played There remain items to correct and improvements to be made But this output was a sign that the pieces to the offensive puzzle are taking shape moving from abstraction to clarity This is what we want and I believe thats what we know were capable of doing Thompson said So we just have to continue to get better every day in practice and then come out here and execute and Coach Gruden Ive said it so many times He just called the perfect plays He called all the right plays and the right times and it was just on us to win our matchups I think everybody collectively did a good job today',\n",

       " 5361: 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 In a complete performance on national television the Redskins dominated the Raiders Despite Oakland entering FedExField with a 20 record and being considered one of the best teams in the NFL it was Washington who put on a complete showing Sunday evening From the getgo Washington controlled Oakland On just the second play from the line of scrimmage the Redskins intercepted a Derek Carr pass Eight plays after the Montae Nicholson pick the Redskins would score a 22yard touchdown between Kirk Cousins and Chris Thompson It laid the foundation for a onesided affair throughout the evening Cousins would finish the night 25of30 for 365 yards and three touchdowns Thompson continued his strong start to the year with 150 receiving yards and the defense allowed just 128 yards fewest surrendered since the 1992 season I think it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody to hold that offense with Marshawn Lynch and Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper the list goes on and on said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden 0for11 on third downs I mean its a great tribute to Coach Greg Manusky and the staff but the players were executing Hustling Making sure of tackles and getting the ball out when they had to In total the Redskins outgained the Raiders 472128 yards The 344yard differential was the largest in regular season action for Washington since Dec 15 1974 a span of 660 regular season games The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding Cousins said All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played 2 The country got to see Chris Thompsons breakout campaign continue Even before Sunday game against the Raiders Thompson was one of the leagues best performers through the first two weeks of the season He had the beautiful touchdown reception in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and then followed it up with two scores against the Los Angeles Rams But Thompsons best game on the young season came against the Raiders as the fourthyear running back logged six receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown It was the most receiving yards in a game by any Redskins running back in records available dating back to 1960 surpassing the 140 receiving yards by running back Dick James on Dec 16 1962 His 188 yards from scrimmage were also the most by any member of the Redskins since Alfred Morris 200yard performance against the Dallas Cowboys Week 17 of the 2012 season I cant explain it said Thompson with a smile when asked about his performance Everybody all around just did a good job for me I got a lot of good looks Our offensive line did such a great job Kirk also he did such a great job just finding me Coach Gruden I think he deserves all of the credit for the offense I think he just called the perfect plays at the right time My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing It was such a great job by him I cant really take a lot of the credit Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays Thompsons best play of his 28 offensive snaps came in the third quarter when he turned a screen pass on 3 rd and19 into a 74yard gain Benefitting from great blocking out of the entire offensive line and Terrelle Pryor Sr Thompson raced down the sideline to not only prevent Oakland from getting the ball back but setting up a Dustin Hopkins field goal Hes a great player man Gruden said Now we have to keep him healthy and hes in a great role where hes at Hes going to be very effective working in third downs a lot were in second down and long a lot He will be utilized in those roles quite frequently 3 The defense heard all about the Raiders offense but quickly put an end to the hoopla surrounding Oaklands unit The defense hadnt had a performance like this in years Not only were the 128 total yards surrendered the teams fewest in 25 seasons Washington held Oakland to just 32 rushing yards fewest since the 2014 season and 96 net passing yards fewest since the 2008 season Despite Oaklands smash mouth style of play it was Washington who set the tempo Marshawn Lynch was bottled up any time he touched the ball and the defense flustered Carr into his first multiinterception game since the 2015 season The defense also sacked him four times We just plan on being physical every game said Jonathan Allen who recorded his first NFL sack off Carr I feel like that is something we want to build as an identity here I feel like we did a good job of doing that You have to give a lot of credit to Jim Tomsula and Greg Manusky coming up with a great game plan and DBs helped us a lot by covering them so we actually have time to get back there and we stopped the run Washingtons defense was at its best on third downs an area theyve struggled with in recent years Oakland had 11 third down attempts They wouldnt convert a single one Our goal was to stop the run and then get off on third down Nicholson said That is pretty much our goal every week I think we did that pretty well Like I said they have a great offense Even to do that it is just a step in the right direction for us Next up is Kansas City so we will go in and just go to work again Thats all we can do 4 Josh Doctson finally struck with a highlight reel touchdown catch In his most extensive NFL action to date Doctson finally found the end zone on one of the best catches during Sundays action After being targeted earlier on the third quarter drive one in which Doctson would drop the ball with David Amerson all over his back the 2016 firstround pick shook off the play to sky over the former Washington cornerback for a 52yard touchdown Despite Cousins slightly underthrowing the deep bomb Doctson adjusted to sky over Amerson and haul the ball in before trotting into the end zone for his first career touchdown It actually came out of the fake trying to throw it to Terrelle and I think Terrelle did end up winning late but I felt 38 TJ Carrie I believe was covering Terrelle was getting out of there and I felt like he was taking away the go ball and if Terrelle did end up getting by him it just shows how fast he really is Cousins said Then I looked back over to Josh and Davis Amerson was getting deep as well but I do like Joshs ball skills and his ability to catch the ball up in the air and I thought you know what Im going to give him a chance they have been asking me to give him that chance and lets give it to him It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Thats why this game is so tough Gruden said it was great to see Doctson finish the play with such ease after having a rough start to his time in Washington due to various injuries I think the players have seen him do that in practice quite often but nobody else has Gruden said You guys dont even get a chance to see it very often so it was good to get Kirk get the ball out of his hands and it wasnt a perfectly thrown ball but to give him a chance where he can go up and make a big time catch hopefully well get more of that But it was great to see man Im happy for Josh and happy that Kirk threw it 5 For the second straight Sunday Night Football game at FedExField the Redskins put on a show While the Redskins have struggled at times in nationally televised games two of Washingtons best performances over the last two years have come on Sunday Night Football Last November the Redskins powered past the Packers for a 4224 victory before silencing the Raiders Sunday with a 2710 victory in a contest that was more lopsided than the final score It marks the first time the Redskins have won backtoback appearances on Sunday Night Football while pushing the teams alltime record on the broadcast package to 18171 Although the game pushed the Redskins season record to 21 players and coaches alike downplayed the significance of the performance Its big but it is not at the same time Nicholson said That sounds weird but its big because like you said it is Sunday Night Football It is primetime Like I said they have a great offense but it isnt at the same time because its our third game Its still early in the season There is still a lot to build on still a lot of corrections to make but like I said it is early in the season I think we will get it together towards the end Gruden added that he didnt care if it was prime time or 1 oclock or midnight He just wanted his team to defend home turf once again We had lost the last two or three at home which was disappointing so to get one at home have it on prime time against a big time team like the Raiders that was satisfying But now we just have to celebrate it for a little bit and then get ready for a tough one Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium',\n",

       " 5508: 'After a couple of playerheld meetings earlier in the week the Redskins defense broke out in major fashion Sunday night against the Raiders with an historical performance in front of a national audience The disrespect festered and lay heavy on the defenses minds throughout the week Safety DJ Swearinger saw it as an opportunity He called a meeting on Tuesday to challenge everyone for the practice week ahead then held another Thursday at cornerback Josh Norman s house to hammer home the message Swearinger called these gatherings get right meetings a sobriquet meant to take the noise from the week an opponent predicting his offensive numbers and analysts betting against them and channel it into a dominating performance to show a national audience why it was so wrong to make assumptions without accounting for this newlook unit From the opening drive the enhanced focus was on full display and the Redskins defense marked by a physical abandon and determination unseen in years past turned an otherwise potent Raiders offensive attack into an insecure and feeble one Washingtons 2710 victory signified many things but none were more noticeable than what the defense achieved what it felt it needed to prove under the lights Sunday night We wanted to change the culture around from the defense from last year to this year I think we made a statement to the world today Swearinger said We got to keep building Its only one game but a great game a hell of a game by our defense by our team to get the team win and we can keep building on this The unquestionable vocal leader of the defense Swearinger heard his message reverberate on the first pass play when rookie Montae Nicholson made an acrobatic interception the first of his career against quarterback Derek Carr The momentum only enhanced from there The defense applied consistent pressure all night without much reinforcement sacking Carr four times and hitting running back Marshawn Lynch early and often One of those hits on Lynch belonged to Swearinger who stood by his locker after the game dressed in a Sean Taylor jersey and donning a Redskins Mexican straw hat calling the violent tackle an ode to his legacy I told the boys all week I said yall going to love it when I catch 24 Lynch Swearinger said I was tired of hearing Beast Mode the dancing all of that I said Im going to catch him I will catch him this game and Im so happy I got to catch him I played him my rookie year and I never got to tackle him my rookie year he retired I tip my hat to Beast Mode I played running back he was my favorite running back growing up But when I got to this level and I wanted to play against him it was more of a enemy So I was happy I got a lick on him today It wasnt just Swearinger laying out the hits Nicholson punished wide receiver Michael Crabtree with a forceful collision to the chest late in the game after the receiver couldnt catch a deep pass in midair Linebacker Zach Brown sped over and flattened anyone in his way slamming them to the ground and the defensive line led by outside linebackers Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith shed blocks with ease In total the Redskins limited the Raiders to 128 total yards the lowest total during head coach Jay Grudens tenure in Washington and the fewest yards allowed by the Redskins since Oct 12 1992 against Denver They also held the Raiders 0for11 on third downs the first time the Redskins have held an opponent without a third down conversion in 10 years Guys were hungry Smith said Guys were trying to hunt thats what our coach says Go out there and hunt We got to get to the quarterback with four guys we shouldnt have to blitz and there wasnt many blitzes called I dont think there was any called and we got inaudible with our four guys up front The defense forced two more turnovers in the game cornerback Kendall Fuller got his first career interception against Carr who threw for just 118 yards and then forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that linebacker Martrell Spaight scooped before running out of bounds and it was clear each unit impacted the next Plastering receivers for four quarters cornerback Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland worked in tandem to limit the Raiders biggest threats Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper to just two total receptions for 13 yards For Norman it was poetic justice and the cornerback didnt mince his words about their performances I mean first and foremost you dont come in here and say what you are going to put up on somebody Norman said Twohundred yards He didnt even catch two balls Oh he only caught one So please whatever you do do not run your mouth to your wide receiver and respect to show up on Sundays Because I am telling you we are here and we are waiting Dont come out here and telling me what youre going to do Show me Youll have to run through me to get that And we aint letting that happen So whatever that young cat said cool youre going to take it back The complete game was enough for Gruden to say it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody Under a new defensive coordinator and with personnel that continues to show its speed intelligence and physicality the Redskins defense made a statement it hopes will continue to grow in the weeks to come We wanted to send a message to the world and were not pushovers were not going to lay down for nobody we are going to compete every time were on the field Swearinger said This defense is definitely going to be stingy every time we are on the field and we are going to keep it rolling We got to keep it rolling we got a big game Monday night next week and we can get better from this week Well watch it on Tuesday and get better and well try to be better on

Josh Doctson s catch against the Raiders indicated the progress hes made practicing on a consistent basis It was a welcome sight Last years firstround draft pick Josh Doctson leapt over cornerback David Amerson and collected a jump ball from Kirk Cousins rolling his way into the end zone for a 52yard score and his first catch of the season The connection offered hope for many fans eager to see the talent they had been promised which was sidelined for the majority of last season and this preseason The catch on Sunday night Gruden said will help to establish more trust between the pairing as will another week of consistent practice with the full squad We have seen that in practice Gruden said of hi acrobatic skills It was good to see it in a game finally Now it is a matter of continuing to work on his route tree We know he can run a goball now we have got to work on his other stuff and the timing He has shown that he can do everything I think it is just a matter of putting day after day together and game after game together He is on the right track without a doubt We are excited to get him more reps and more balls 2 DJ Swearinger brings attitude and leadership to a defense that played one of its best games in history last week Of the many offseason moves and roster changes the Redskins have undergone none might be as important as the signing of safety DJ Swearinger who has seamlessly taken over as the teams vocal leader and defensive captain Hes just a fiery guy a guy that knows football across the board and I love that Manusky said I love his spirit and he gets guys around him to rally behind him and hes taking us where we need to be Were not there right now but were getting there His natural ability to lead a diverse group of players has paid dividends on the field operating as the eyes and ears of the defense and translating his intelligence to the whole unit In fact hes made it a priority to host two defensive meetings each week for the entire unit going over game plans and helping every level understand how the other will be functioning Its gone a long way so far Its one thing being a vocal guy but you have to back it up with production and sound play and know what you are talking about Gruden said Ive had guys before that are talkers that dont know what they are doing but he brings both He brings an edge to him that rubs off on people Not to say we didnt have that before but it is just an added dimension with him being here He also has a great knowledge of our system already and he can communicate that well with the other safeties young safeties the linebackers and what have you and the corners Communication is key on defense 3 The defense must swarm to Kareem Hunt to limit his production this Monday An immoveable object will meet an unstoppable force this Monday night or something close to that The Redskins defense is allowing just 623 rushing yards per game good for second best in the league while the Chiefs boast rookie running back Kareem Hunt who leads the league in rushing yards with 401 and scrimmage yards with 538 I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times You know No 10 Tyreek Hill in the backfield and No 13 DeAnthony Thomas in the backfield two fast guys that can really split you down the middle and also running the ball They are two effective guys that can run to the edge The challenge for the Redskins will also be staying on their keys and not getting duped on misdirection and deceptive formations the Chiefs like to show I think he has great vision number one Gruden said of Hunt I mentioned the contact balance that he has and obviously he has got the speed to run through holes He has done very good They have a great scheme over there They keep you offbalance They have got the zone reads going They have got the jet sweeps They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football 4 The defensive unit is starting to gel with increased time playing together With so many new parts needing to sync together its been an impressive beginning to the season for the Redskins defense which has in consecutive weeks limited opponents run games and played the brand of aggressive football fans have waited to see for some time Gruden noted that aiding this transition of new parts including Swearinger linebacker Zach Brown and defensive linemen Stacy McGee and Terrell McClain is the experience they all brought with them These guys have played a lot of football Gruden said It is just a matter of getting together with the terminology and playing well with your teammates What drew us to those guys Jonathan Allen obviously was their work ethic how hard they played They all seemed like smart guys and they fit in well Manusky has seen steady improvement the more they have played in games together expecting their unity to grow over the coming weeks Its great to get a lot of reps of seeing these guys playing together Manusky said Sometimes when youre coming out of the preseason and stuff some guys get 10 reps 15 reps or 20 reps its hard to get a good judge on what they can do and what they cant do Overall weve been pretty successful in the last couple of weeks From the players perspective theyre doing a good job I think theyre building camaraderie amongst themselves and were playing together and good things happen 5 Injured players are on the mend Washington received a handful of injuries following the Rams game that prevented a few starters from playing against Oakland After an extra day of rest this week everyone but for tackle Ty Nsekhe who received core muscle surgery on Tuesday was back at practice and there is more optimism surrounding many of their returns While limited in practice Thursday running back Rob Kelly tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Mason Foster all participated in individual drills Gruden isnt exactly sure the prognosis for them yet but their practicing is a positive sign We will see Gruden said when it came to Reed He felt better today did more team stuff today But we will have to wait and see So I dont know Gruden did also mention that defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis sustained a rotator cuff injury during the Raiders game Gruden is confident he should be able to play on Monday but Anthony Lanier II will be ready if needed',\n",

when the Redskins win KEEP DOCTSON IN THE LOOP For most starting wide receivers in the NFL having just one catch through three games isnt necessarily something to write home about But for Redskins wide receiver Josh Doctson his one catch a 52yard touchdown reception against the Oakland Raiders could be the start of a new chapter for the 2016 firstround pick After a rookie season almost completely wiped away by different Achilles injuries Doctson has been active for Washingtons first three games of the season Despite his health the TCU product wasnt targeted in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and was located just once by quarterback Kirk Cousins against the Los Angeles Rams His touchdown reception one in which he timed a jump perfectly over Raiders cornerback David Amerson proved what hes capable of though We have seen that in practice said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden of Doctsons catch It was good to see it in a game finally Now it is a

against Kansas Citys defense especially if Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters is being matched up with fellow Redskins wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr Hes been so confident said Redskins cornerback Josh Norman His approach to the game and practices he makes all those plays in practice that you all saw down on the field in the game For us we see it in the game its like You do it out here in practice and lo and behold his time came and his shot was there He made the most of it To see him capture that moment and come in here like that I know it was a big big sigh of relief for him with those things off his shoulders Now we actually see that come to fruition what he put in practice and its a beautiful thing to see Everybody was rooting for him and Im glad that he could come in and make a play like that for the team Stephen Czarda HUNT DOWN KAREEM Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt was virtually a noname heading into Week 1 After losing original starter Spencer Ware before the opening game against the New England Patriots the Chiefs called upon their thirdround pick Hunt fumbled his first handoff but made few errors from then on Now Hunt is playing like a veteran in his prime Hes the leagues leading rusher through three games with 401 yards 113 more than his secondplace competitor Dalvin Cook He has yet to fumble since Week 1 and has not averaged below five yards a carry in any of his games He also has at least one run of 50 or more yards in every game this season and has scored at least one touchdown in each contest I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times Hunt also provides an added dimension to Kansas Citys already explosive offense With so much productivity in the ground game Chiefs head coach Andy Reid can open up the passing game for quarterback Alex Smith Gruden said these different offensive schemes can put a defense on its heels They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football Gruden said Coach Reid does an excellent job with his offense and disguising his intent using a lot of different guys to touch the ball a lot of skill Washington will have to rely on its defensive playmakers like cornerback Josh Norman and linebacker Zach Brown to try and bottle up Hunt before he breaks off another 50yard run With linebacker Mason Foster still nursing an injury Hunt may look to the middle of the field for his next big play Brandon Hill COOLING OFF ALEX SMITH Alex Smith was drafted No 1overall by San Francisco in 2005 and has since endured a lengthy career in the NFL starting 75 games for the 49ers before his arrival in Kansas City more than four years ago Despite the vast experience he boasts Smith might be playing better now than he ever has in his career As it stands heading into Week 4 the 33yearold tops the league in passer rating completion percentage and game winning drives among other categories He has generally played mistakefree football as well passing for seven touchdowns and no interceptions He has done this all while leading the NFLs thirdbest offense in terms of yards per game While much of the national attention has been paid to Hunt and explosive wide receiver Tyreek Hill Smith is a big reason why the Chiefs have jumped out to a 30 record Despite the changes hes seen in efficiency and production lately he has stuck to one tactic that has helped him throughout his NFL career staying mobile He is one of those guys that can avoid trouble and hurt you with his legs Gruden said of Smith You can have everybody covered downfield but he can rush for the first downs on thirdandeight thirdand10 whatever it is Smiths hot start will be put to the test on Monday night however as he goes up against a Redskins defense that is coming off a fantastic performance against the Raiders The unit was able to force four sacks two fumbles and two interceptions Jay Cannon SHOW EM SUNDAY WAS NO FLUKE Redskins safety DJ Swearinger took all of the talk about the Raiders last week personally Yes Oakland was entering the game with a 20 record and fresh off a 124 season last year But almost no one outside of the Redskins was giving the team much of a chance Then the game happened and it was a onesided blowout courtesy of a dominating defensive performance Washington hadnt experienced in 25 years When I had the meeting on Tuesday I said nobodys going to give us a chance to win Swearinger said following the 2710 victory The NFL wants the Oakland Raiders to come in Washington and beat up on the Washington Redskins and as a defense were not going to let that happen Regardless of what the offense and special teams do we control the game if they dont score they dont win and whichever the offense how many yards they put up tonight rushing yards passing yards I mean I think our defense stood up and really made a statement on the No 1 offense in the league While it was an impressive outing this weeks matchup may be even tougher Not only are the Chiefs one of just two remaining unbeaten teams the Redskins have to play in Arrowhead Stadium The Redskins will be seeking backtoback road victories on Monday Night Football for the first time since 2005 and 2007 while pushing their prime time record this year to 20 You can never really get too comfortable Foster said Its the NFL everybody gets paid everybodys a playmaker so any game on a national stage like this against a great coach and a great offense is a big game So youve got to approach it like that Stephen Czarda',\n",

       " 6521: 'When the Redskins signed linebacker Zach Brown in the offseason one of his first promises to the secondary was that it wouldnt need to worry about tackling So far thats been the case When head coach Jay Gruden thinks of linebacker Zach Brown one play comes to mind that exemplifies the impact hes had on the Redskins through three games Early in the second quarter during the teams victory over the Rams quarterback Jared Goff found tight end Gerald Everett wide open down the right sideline and a 75yard touchdown looked inevitable But sprinting at full capacity and catching up to him was Brown who made a tackle just six yards before the goal line His speed shows up a lot Gruden said Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in gameday when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed But that play was also indicative of a promise that Brown made to his defensive backs when he was signed in the offseason Second in the league in tackles last season 149 and second again entering Week 4 with 33 Browns biggest attribute has been bringing players to the ground letting his corners and safeties focus primarily on coverage duties On that neartouchdown catch Brown knew that safety Deshazor Everett could have also tackled the Rams tight end before the goal line but wanted to clean up the mess himself In my mind I want to protect my corners and the secondary Brown said I dont want nobody picking on them nobody trying to make dumb tackles Were going to tackle were going to defeat the block that you got coming for us and were going to go get them Me and Mason Foster and the front seven will make sure you dont have to tackle no running back he added A lot of people get hurt tackling a running back Its one of the many reasons why cornerback Josh Norman smiling at his recent locker room session with the media said of Brown he makes the job a whole lot easier and then summed up his thoughts Boy I love Zach Brown Someone else sharing that sentiment and reaping the rewards of Browns tackling abilities is cornerback Bashaud Breeland who sits next to Brown in the locker room and likes to share conversation about their nearby hometowns in South Carolina Hes already noticed a difference in Browns speed letting him play observer to opposing running backs being tackled Through three games Breeland has just eight tackles After two games last season before he injured himself early against the Giants Breeland had already collected 19 tackles Last year around this time I probably had around 20some tackles Breeland said Now I really dont have to worry about the tackling If I do he kind of beats me to him or he assists me Hes all of over the field Thats a great addition to the team Hes making it easy for us While safety DJ Swearinger has already been anointed the vocal leader of the defense Brown has earned a similar leadership role for his play on the field and during times of crisis Take last Sundays game against the Raiders for example when defensive coordinator Greg Manuskys communication system failed during several plays Brown stepped in to make the calls without it They made a call and they played it Manusky said So whatever the call was that Zach Brown made in the middle we played it It was an indication of the trust players have in Brown as well as the inside linebackers intelligence and readiness to step up when needed If youre the other linebacker on the field youre going to know the calls you have to know the calls make sure you know where everybodys supposed to be because you never know Brown said When Mason Foster went down I had to call the calls so you just have to know Because somebody might not know what theyre supposed to do so youve got to tell them youve got to be able to communicate with them on defense and its trust too They trust me to make the call Brown has garnered that trust by doing the little things he said showing up on time to meetings correcting mistakes on the field and communicating constantly about miscues that can be fastened up Browns goal one he stated during OTAs is to be the defensive MVP this season an award often given to those with high tackle totals But individual statistics can sometimes be misleading as Brown hopes them to be for the remainder of the season Good defenses get around 55 plays so if you get around 55 plays youre not going to have as many tackles Brown said But your defense is going to be that good So for us as a defense were trying to cut down our plays because the more you cut down your pays the more youre off the field So thats a big goal of ours Still the tackles he does acquire will continue to make a difference keeping the secondary out of harms way as the Redskins keep building on their defensive cohesiveness',\n",

City would march all the way down to Washingtons 14yard line before the Chiefs rookie kicker converted a 32yard attempt with less than five minutes left in the quarter The ensuing Redskins drive would start with a first down reception by Terrelle Pryor Sr before Chris Thompson tallied a twoyard gain On 3 rd and8 from the Washington 43yard line Kirk Cousins would scramble to his right to pick up a new set of downs The Redskins went back to Thompson on another first down run which once again went for two yards before Cousins once again picked up a first down with his legs before the twominute warning On the first play after the break Cousins once again tucked it and ran for an eightyard gain before Thompson was stuffed on a second down carry With a little more than a minute left in the frame Cousins tried to hit Josh Doctson for a gamewinning touchdown but the receiver didnt complete posession of the ball Dustin Hopkins however would tie the game on a 40yard attempt With 47 seconds left in the quarter Kansas Citys offense got the ball back and would drive into Washington territory before the Redskins used their second timeout Harrison Butker came on for a 43yard field goal which he would make with four seconds left in the game Washington would try some magic on the final play of the game but it would result in a fumble recovered for touchdown with no time left Third Quarter

advantage of multiple Redskins penalties on the first drive of the third quarter one that would end with an Alex Smith oneyard touchdown run It looked like Washington was going to get off the field after a third down stop inside the fiveyard line but Preston Smith was called for offsides to give Kansas City one more chance to strike The Redskins responded quickly though driving 75 yards in just three plays before Ryan Grant scored his second touchdown of the season On the first play of the drive tight end Vernon Davis caught the ball before weaving in and out of the Chiefs defense for a

on the board early in the second quarter even if it was just a field goal but a sack by Matt Ioannidis on 3 rd and7 from the 31yard line pushed Kansas City out of scoring range After the Chiefs punt went into the end zone for a touchback the Redskins were able to get into Chiefs territory but were unable to extend their lead On the drive running back Rob Kelley was deemed questionable to return with an ankle injury while tackle Trent Williams is dealing with a knee injury His return is also questionable On the Chiefs next drive the defense continued to hold strong Cornerbacks Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland laid backtoback big hits on Kansas Citys skill players but a flag on Breeland on a third down play that was originally an Alex Smith incompletion kept the drive alive Despite the extra set of downs Washington didnt allow Kansas City to sniff scoring range The offenses response would last just three plays though as Kansas City forced their first threeandout on the night The Chiefs took advantage scoring their first touchdown of the night on a Travis Kelce 17yard reception Washington would go into the twominute offense after the touchdown Quarterback Kirk Cousins quickly

compete with any team in the NFL losing such a close battle is tough Im an ultimate competitor but I feel like this game shows a lot about this team that we got a pretty darn good football team said cornerback Quinton Dunbar And it shows where were at and it shows that if we keep battling keep believing in each other keep believing in the coaches and the gameplan when we get back off this bye its going to be a special 12 weeks Despite falling in the closing seconds after the Chiefs nailed a field goal with eight seconds left Pryor believes the Redskins proved they are fighters We battled a team thats pretty darn good on paper Pryor said When they came in here theyre 40 for a reason obviously We had a lot of opportunities We led in the game a long time then we came back and punched them after they hit us back in the mouth and we punched them back We just needed to score a touchdown A field goal doesnt win games Touchdowns do Its unfortunate that we couldnt get that first down late in the red zone and that was the last time we saw the ball really 2 Headlined by Josh Norman s rib injury the defense had to go deep into their rotations against one of the leagues most explosive offenses Norman did not play at all in the second half of Mondays 2920 loss to the Chiefs as the cornerback suffered a rib injury that could sideline him for some time But the former AllPro wasnt the only defensive player that needed attention from the teams training staff as Dubar safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett and even Foster missed some plays in a second half in which Kansas City controlled the ball a majority of the time For Norman his loss was especially difficult on the defense as he was setting a tempo against Kansas Citys offense On one play prior to his exit Norman laid a big hit on Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce I came in and got Xrays and saw one of my ribs had something done to it Norman said I wanted to come back out but the team specialist thought it was best if I stay out I said I was but its a long season We just want to be cautious With the defense wanting to be more physical this season Foster admitted that sometimes players are going to get a little banged up But the younger players provided a glimpse of their potential while instilling trust that they can match the starters intensity on the field When youve got guys on this defense playing as hard as they do flying around playing special teams playing their heart out every single snap you are going to see guys get hurt and nicked up Foster said But thats why the other guys practice I mean everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how defensive coordinator Greg Manusky coaches it so everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 3 Kirk Cousins continued his string of solid performances in front of a national stage In Washingtons season opening loss to Philadelphia Cousins fumbled twice including one that sealed the Redskins fate along with throwing an untimely fourth quarter interception in the red zone But in recent weeks the Michigan State product has bounced back While Monday wasnt his most prolific game Cousins played mistakefree football He finished the night completing 14of24 passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns He also registered a passer rating of 1167 I think in this league the 16week season is a grind and its not for the faint of heart Cousins said Youve got to be physically emotionally and mentally tough Nobody feels sorry for you if you arent You just try to stay the course and be really toughminded and whatever gets thrown at you just take it in stride Cousins was also able to showcase his mobility particularly on a late gametying field goal drive While the Chiefs were unable to sack the quarterback on the night they did flush him out of the pocket a few times Cousins however took advantage of some open running lanes as he carried the ball three different times for 33 yards When teams play man coverage thats when you really have an opportunity to run because guys are chasing their man and they dont have eyes on you Cousins said They did a good job of taking guys away and doubling some people and really all I had was to run and I think thats an area of my game that I can use more I think Its there for the taking if I get through a progression and dont find anything and take off and run instead of throw it away Cousins also came close to throwing a gamewinning touchdown on the drive as he lofted a beautiful ball to wide receiver Josh Doctson but the pair was unable to connect for a touchdown in consecutive weeks We just didnt hit that third down play Cousins said Well go back and look at a couple of other plays throughout the game that couldve made a big difference but allinall we played well I was pleased there were so few penalties on offense We played pretty mistakefree I think in a lot of ways showed some maturity from that standpoint Tough one to lose It felt like we had a chance there and didnt get it done 4 Vernon Davis continues to show that he has a lot left in the tanks One of the reasons why the Redskins had just four offensive plays in the third quarter was due to a 69yard reception by Davis After the Chiefs jumped out to their first lead of the game at 1410 midway through the third quarter Cousins found Davis open on the right side of the field While the initial reception would have easily netted the Redskins a new set of downs Davis continued to defy Father Time as the 33yearold tight end weaved in and out of the Chiefs defense for the nearly 70plusyard gain Not only was the reception Davis longest since a 73yard catch on Jan 3 2010 it moved him into the top 10 alltime in NFL history in receiving yards among tight ends Davis now has eight catches for 120 yards in the last three games We call him el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Cousins said We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 5 The bye week comes at the perfect time With the Redskins battling injuries on both sides of the ball the players will extra time to heal their wounds before returning to game action on Sunday Oct 15 against the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md We get a chance to rest get some treatment and really ice up and get ready to make a big run said Foster who suffered a dislocated shoulder in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Rams So I think its perfect timing we know what were capable of so we got to get it corrected and focus on that and then come back and just let it get on a roll try to tag them together so its coming at the perfect time Norman agreed with Foster as the cornerback hopes to not miss any time with his rib injury A lot of us are banged up right now Norman said Were going to go back and lick our wounds come back out here in a week and try to get a W We came out here for it so its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that',\n",

       " 6866: 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda provides five things weve learned about the Washington Redskins through the first four games Eagles Rams Raiders and Chiefs of the 2017 regular season 1 The defense is looking like a completely different unit this year One season after the Redskins finished 28 th in total defense the unit looks anew this season under Greg Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator in the offseason after spending the 2016 season as the teams outside linebackers coach Through the first four games of the season the Redskins rank 10 th in total defense allowing just a little more than 311 yards per contest Washington also ranks third in the NFL in total sacks 12 while allowing just 69 first downs Washingtons best defensive performance in 25 seasons came in a 2710 victory over the Oakland Raiders as the defense allowed just 128 yards the fewest yards allowed by Washington in a game since Oct 12 1992 They also didnt allow Oakland to convert on all 11 of their third down plays I think we played very strong in the middle of our defense said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Our defensive linemen did a great job being stout Our outside backers were stout in the running game and held them to minimal yards per carry and forced them to throw the ball in known passing situations enabled our rush to get home and our coverage was tight I think just all around the calls were sound the players executed we tackled extremely well we flew to the football didnt give up any big plays whatsoever other than the touchdown pass after the turnover I think when youre talking about a defense that played that well I think its impossible to just say This is why I think its because everybody who took part played well played hard played with great passion and energy and played smart This success is also coming with linebacker Trent Murphy and defensive lineman Phil Taylor both of whom were expected to be key rotational players sidelined for the year with injuries and the team having to quickly determine a new strong safety plan when Sua Cravens was placed on the ReserveLefft Squad list The units depth was tested against the Kansas City Chiefs as numerous players including cornerbacks Josh Norman and Quinton Dunbar along with safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett were all sidelined for certain periods of time with injury Everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how Manusky coaches it said linebacker Mason Foster who sealed Washingtons Week 2 victory over the Rams with a late interception So everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 2 Vernon Davis continues to be The Ageless One For most teams having their No 1 tight end limited would be troublesome But the Redskins arent like most teams in the NFL with the depth they have at the position With Jordan Reed has been slowed by various injuries so far this year Davis has stepped up in a big way for the offense After not being targeted in Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the 33yearold has caught eight passes for 160 yards 11 th most among tight ends and one touchdown His 20 yards per reception also leads all tight ends In the Redskins blowout victory over the Raiders Davis caught a 22yard touchdown pass in the second quarter Then against the Chiefs in Week 4 Davis caught two passes for 89 yards 69 of which came when Davis outran two defenders to initial catch the ball before weaving his way through traffic Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said Just out here at practice hes running around like a 20yearold kid Were going to have to try to dive into that but I know he has a great routine in the offseason during the season His diet is topnotch His workouts are on point Not to mention he prepares and hes just always got a smile on his face Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player Quarterback Kirk Cousins added that Davis has earned the nickname el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Cousins said Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 3 New faces have led the way for the defensive unit One of the reasons why the Redskins have seen such positive early returns on the defensive side of the ball is because of some of the players that were brought in this offseason Yes Ryan Kerrigan and Josh Norman continue to play at a high level Matt Ioannidis also looks like a completely different player this year too But the likes of DJ Swearinger Zach Brown and Jonathan Allen have made a difference After an offseason competition for the starting inside linebacker spots Brown earned the nod to be the No 1 Mo linebacker and he hasnt disappointed The 2016 Pro Bowler currently tops the NFL in tackles with 42 I think his speed really shows up on tape Gruden said Plays that for instance the Rams game when the kid broke a long run the tight end who ran a 45 at the combine or whatever he ran he got hawked down by Zach Brown and what the heck did Zach Brown run then So his speed shows up a lot Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in game day when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed Swearinger meanwhile is a vocal presence in the defensive backfield But his presence goes well beyond the lines Hes recently hosted a playersonly Get Right meeting to focus on corrections I emphasize all the small things Sort of the small things that coaches dont cover that experience has to give you Swearinger said Thats what I try to give them Theyre growing Shazor Deshazor Everett hes doing great Montae Nicholson is doing great Those guys Im a young guy but I feel like Im an old guy with these young guys I feel like a proud big bro especially with Montae and Shazor but Im going to stay on those guys and theyre going to continue to get better As for Allen Washingtons firstround pick in this years draft has been productive in the trenches He continues to lead the defensive lines rotation as he grows with every passing week Thats the beauty thats the most exciting thing about Jonathan He just hasnt scratched the surface of his own potential yet Gruden said He is just going to get better and better the more he sees and the more he plays 4 Chris Thompson has been one of the leagues breakout players so far Entering the season Gruden remained committed in his belief that Thompson is one of the best thirddown backs in the NFL Then the Redskins remained committed in their belief that Thompson should remain in Washington for a few more years as they signed him to a contract extension before the regular season opener Through the first four weeks of the season the 2013 fifthround pick has recorded 20 carries for 142 yards and two touchdowns along with 14 receptions for 235 yards and two receiving touchdowns Thompson is just one rushing yard off from leading Washington in both rushing and receiving I think the temptation early on was Man hes a little smallish Can he hold up How much can you give him the ball how much can you play him He was a big part of special teams But then when hes on the field hes so productive in every phase of the game said Redskins offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh Hes a good runner very good runner Hes got great explosion Hes excellent in running routes and catching the ball and hes a very good pass protector Against the Eagles in the opener Thompson recorded the Redskins first touchdown of the season when he caught a short pass and flipped it into a 29yard touchdown off a magical play The next week he logged two more touchdowns against the Rams before accumulating 188 yards from scrimmage against the Raiders While theres certainly a temptation to get Thompson more and more reps Gruden wants to keep his role one that hes excelling in defined Ive said before hes a very valuable guy in the role that hes in third down Gruden said Hes also one of our kick returners He does a lot of getting back on track calls on second downandlong and theres some firstdown plays that hes in But yes its important for us to keep him healthy Hes not a guy that I personally want to give him 30 carries a game He probably wants it but he probably wont get it 5 After one of his worst outings in the opener Cousins is starting to round into form again It was a game in which the Pro Bowl quarterback didnt look himself Coming off a season in which he threw for nearly 5000 yards Cousins struggled against the Eagles in Week 1 He completed only 23of40 passes for 240 yards with one touchdown to one interception The interception was one of three turnovers from Cousins as the quarterback skied an errant pass on a crucial third down throw Then minutes later the quarterback was stripped sack as he was trying to mount a gamewinning drive But in the three games since the opener Cousins has been nearly flawless Along with leading a successful gamewinning drive against the Rams Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts against the Raiders 25of35 for 365 yards with three touchdowns In total against the Rams Raiders and Chiefs Cousins is 57of81 for 764 yards with six touchdowns to no interceptions I think there is a lot to like really I think especially after the first game Gruden said He got a lot of pressure He was a little bit inaccurate the first game more so then he ever has been but a lot of that had to do with the pressure that Philly gave him People were in his face quite often I think he has improved dramatically Week 2 Week 3 and even against the Chiefs I was impressed that last drive He had a couple huge scrambles using his legs big runs to get us into a position to get a tying field goal or possibly win the game if Josh can hang on to the ball Kirk is playing well and he is getting us in position to win Thats all you can ask for at the end of the day I have been impressed with Kirk in the way he has come on after Week 1',\n",

       " 6989: 'Heres a look at the remaining games slated for the Redskins following the Week 5 bye Washington has yet to play two of their division rivals and will have two trips to the West Coast before the seasons end The Washington Redskins had a grueling first quarter of the season Pro Football Reference ranked Washingtons fourgame slate as the toughest in the NFL The Los Angeles Rams Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs all sit atop their divisions The only Redskins opponent not leading their division would be the Oakland Raiders who recently lost Derek Carr to a multipleweek injury Luckily for Washington the remaining 12 games on the schedule rank among the easiest in the league right now according to FootballOutsiderscom with many teams posting records below 500 four games into the season Heres a look at whats ahead for the Redskins for the rest of the regular season Week 6 San Francisco 49ers 04 4 th place in NFC West Top Passer Brian Hoyer 858 yards 2 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Carlos Hyde 321 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Pierre Garon 20 receptions 285 yards 0 touchdowns The 49ers seemed to have an immediate upgrade at receiver after acquiring former Redskins starter PierreGaron in the offseason However Garons numbers do not quite match up to last years This is not at all aided by quarterback Brian Hoyers high interception total and inability to score in the red zone The offense has been outscored 4914 through the air The defense is an area that has exceeded expectations San Francisco has the sixthhighest rate of quarterback pressures through four weeks Week 7 Philadelphia Eagles 31 1 st place in NFC East Top Passer Carson Wentz 1058 yards 6 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher LeGarrette Blount 249 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Zach Ertz 26 receptions 326 yards 1 touchdown Quarterback Carson Wentz has refined his game after a bumpy rookie campaign He already has a third of the passing yards he accumulated last year After defeating the Redskins at FedExField in Week 1 snapping a fivegame losing streak against Washington the Eagles will have the comfort of a home crowd in the battle for the NFC East crown Tight end Zach Ertz may lead the team in receiving yards but new addition Alshon Jeffery gives the Eagles a legitimate deep threat at receiver Jeffery has 215 yards on 17 catches this season with two touchdowns Week 8 Week 13 Dallas Cowboys 22 2 nd place in NFC East Top Passer Dak Prescott 941 yards 8 touchdowns 3 interceptions Top Rusher Ezekiel Elliott 277 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Dez Bryant 16 receptions 212 yards 2 touchdowns There has been plenty of drama on and off the field for the Dallas Cowboys Running back Ezekiel Elliot has broken 100 yards on the ground just once through four games and averages two yards fewer per carry compared to last year Meanwhile quarterback Dak Prescott who only had four interceptions in 2016 has nearly reached that mark through four games On defense the Cowboys have a gem in defensive end Demarcus Lawrence who leads the NFL in sacks with 75 Rookie linebacker Jaylon Smith has also been a force to reckon with recording a teamhigh 34 tackles The Cowboys were favorited by pundits to win the NFC East before the year began but so far have just one less loss than they did during the entire 2016 season Week 9 Seattle Seahawks 22 2 nd place in NFC West Top Passer Russell Wilson 1024 yards 7 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Carson 208 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Doug Baldwin 23 receptions 247 yards 1 touchdown Seattle knows how to win with just a few key elements strong defense and crafty playmaking from Russell Wilson Wilson the teams second leading rusher with 138 yards has been on the run for most of the season due to a shaky offensive line Eddy Lacy was brought in during the offseason to fill in as the groundandpound running back a spot previously occupied by Marshawn Lynch So far Lacy has been ineffective notching only 55 yards The Seahawks have outscored opponents 108 to 63 and held their last opponent the Indianapolis Colts to just three points in the second half of a big victory The Seattle defense has only allowed a team to score more than 18 just once this season Week 10 Minnesota Vikings 22 3 rd place in NFC North Top Passer Case Keenum 755 yards 3 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Dalvin Cook 354 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Stefon Diggs 22 receptions 391 yards 4 touchdowns The Vikings looked like the team to beat in the North after quarterback Sam Bradford led his team to a 2919 win over the New Orleans Saints in the regular season opener Unfortunately for Minnesota Bradford went down with a knee injury It looked like the Vikings would rely on the running game to carry the offense but rookie tailback Dalvin Cook tore his ACL while making a cut against the Detroit Lions in Week 4 Now the Vikings have relied but quarterback Case Keenum and receiver Stefon Diggs to help put points on the board which may still be the case by Week 10 when the Redskins host Minnesota at FedExField The defense remains the one constant for the team allowing an average of 19 points per game The team excels in creating interceptions totaling three on the season at times but has yet to force a fumble The run defense has also been impressive allowing just 285 yards on the ground through four games Week 11 New Orleans Saints 22 4 th place in NFC South Top Passer Drew Brees 1135 yards 8 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Mark Ingram 170 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Michael Thomas 25 receptions 310 yards 2 touchdowns At 38 years old Drew Brees continues to defy his age Currently the leagues fourthleading passer Brees averages 2765 yards per game as he inches closer to the NFLs alltime passing record At running back Adrian Peterson seems to have taken a backseat in head coach Sean Paytons offense The 11year veteran has only 27 carries on the year for 81 yards The defense was the biggest concern for the Saints during their first three games New Orleans had the second highest yards allowed per game heading into Week 4 but quickly turned things around in London shutting out the Miami Dolphins By Week 11 it should be clear whether this defensive performance was a fluke or if serious improvement has been underway in the Big Easy Week 12 Week 17 New York Giants 04 4 th place in NFC East Top Passer Eli Manning 1113 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Paul Perkins 61 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Sterling Shephard 21 receptions 254 yards 1 touchdown The Giants 04 start might be the biggest surprise in the NFL Turnovers have played a large part in New Yorks journey to the bottom of the league Manning has thrown the ball to defenders four times while opposing quarterbacks have yet to throw a pick against the Giants defense The team brought in receiver Brandon Marshall during the offseason to compliment Odell Beckham Jr but neither wideout has played up to par Sterling Shephard however has burst onto the scene as the Giants leading receiver gaining 49 more yards than Beckham and 54 more yards than Marshall The Giants have also been seriously outgained on the ground Opponents have run for 571 yards against New Yorks defense while the Giants own backs have only managed 237 yards Washingtons last game of the season will be played at MetLife Stadium and the outcome may shape the final standings of the NFC East Week 14 Los Angeles Chargers 04 4 th place in AFC West Top Passer Philip Rivers 1107 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Melvin Gordon 168 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Keenan Allen 24 receptions 334 yards 1 touchdown Facing two teams who started 04 may be the morale boost Washington needs heading into the final stretch of the season The recently relocated Chargers have had trouble maintaining consistency on defense Los Angeles ranks last in yards allowed after first contact with 26 and has been outgained on the ground 654 yards to 270 yards Meanwhile quarterback Philip Rivers has caught the interception bug not at all helped by the fact that he has been sacked six times this season This isnt to say the Chargers have been a pushover all season Excluding a 14point loss to the Chiefs the Chargers have been outscored by an average of 23 points Week 15 Arizona Cardinals 22 3 rd place in NFC West Top Passer Carson Palmer 1282 yards 5 touchdowns 5 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Johnson 93 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Larry Fitzgerald 26 receptions 276 yards 2 touchdowns Its never good when a quarterbacks touchdowns and interceptions totals are equal and his sack total of 17 tops the NFL However Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense have found ways to win by the narrowest of margins The Cardinals never meant to lean on Palmers arm but a Week 1 injury to running back David Johnson severely limited Arizonas ground game The defense has created opportunities but has failed to capitalize forcing four fumbles but never recovering Three interceptions have led to better field position for the offense but if Arizona wants to hold its own against Washington Palmer will have to keep the ball away from Josh Norman and the rest of the Redskins secondary So far Washingtons secondary has done well in creating turnovers Week 16 Denver Broncos 31 2 nd place in AFC West Top Passer Trevor Siemian 888 yards 7 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher CJ Anderson 330 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Demaryius Thomas 18 receptions 247 yards 0 touchdowns After once again earning the starting role in the offseason quarterback Trevor Siemian has performed admirably through 2017 However his 13 sacks are tied for fifth highest in the league When the offensive line struggles in pass protection it exceeds expectations in creating running lanes CJ Anderson and the rest of the Denver running attack has outrushed opponents by 369 yards This is in part due to the best facet of Denvers game the defense The front seven contained running backs to 24 yards per carry and allowed an average of 508 yards a game The unit also has two recovered fumbles and four interceptions on the year Luckily for the Redskins the Broncos will have to descend from their milehigh city and meet Washington at FedExField for the last home game of the season',\n",

the Washington Redskins have compiled a gallery of highlights From the lastminute win against the Los Angeles Rams to the Sunday Night blowout of the Oakland Raiders Washingtons players on offense and defense made some outstanding feats Here is some of the best of Redskins football a quarter of the way through the 2017 season Kerrigans PickSix Ignites FedEx Field With a 13point deficit against a division rival at home Washingtons season opener was about to get out of hand Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz had eluded the Redskins front seven and had already thrown two touchdowns If not for linebacker Ryan Kerrigan Washington may have been down by three touchdowns before halftime On the Eagles fifth drive Wentz tossed a short pass the right sideline The ball was tipped at the line by defensive lineman Stacy McGee wobbled off course and landed right in Kerrigans hands From there it was a short 25yard jog to the end zone Its what you practice every day just catching the ball and taking it to the house Kerrigan said Fortunate to find myself in that situation and fortunate to make the play Kerrigan scored Washingtons first points of the season and brought his team right back in the game Thompson Bullies His Way To Incredible TD Washingtons second big play of the season came when the team needed it most Down 137 against the Eagles the Redskins were on the move and within scoring range Cousins feeling the pressure from the blitz checked down to running back Chris Thompson in the middle of the field Thompson sprinted and spun his way through four missed tackles before reaching the end zone His 29yard catchandrun gave Washington its first and only lead of the game I was just looking to make a big play Thompson said I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play Thompson Goes 61 Yards To The House Thompson continued his highlightfilled campaign in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams With a 1310 lead head coach Jay Gruden called in a delayed handoff for the gadget running back The Rams fell for the draw rushing towards Cousins who quickly gave the ball to his running back My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing Thompson said Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays A few nice blocks busted the field wide open for Thompson who never touched a defender on his way to the end zone The Redskins went up 2010 following the extra point and eventually earned their first win of the season Foster Seals Win In LA With Interception Rookie quarterback Jared Goff had kept his Los Angeles Rams afloat against the Redskins and needed just one drive to tie things up at 27 in the fourth quarter With seconds ticking off the clock Goff dropped back at his own 28yard line and slung the ball to receiver Cooper Kupp What Goff didnt see was linebacker Mason Foster making a beeline for the ball He cut in front up Kupp and bobbled the ball before securing the interception Foster who had been battling a shoulder injury during the game slid down at the 19yardline essentially ending the game and handing Washington its first win I mean it definitely feels great Foster said I felt like I had to redeem myself for some of the plays last week I felt like I could have been better on Doctson Hauls In 52Yard Bomb From Cousins Wide receiver Josh Doctson barely saw the field his rookie year and spent most of his time sidelined and injured During the Redskins Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders Doctson blazed back into action redeeming himself on a 52yard touchdown pass Washington had already put up 14 points on the Raiders but it was Doctsons score that put the nail in the coffin On first down quarterback Kirk Cousins fired deep to the TCU product who had to contest with cornerback David Amerson for the 5050 ball Doctson miraculously came down with the catch and fought to reach the end zone Amerson still wrapped around his waist Nicholson and Fuller Light Up Sunday Night Before Week 3 Oakland quarterback Derek Carr had not been intercepted It took just one pass against Washingtons secondary for that to change One Carrs first pass attempt of the game receiver Amari Cooper slowed down just enough for the ball to sail out of reach Safety Montae Nicholson flew in and snatched the ball before Cooper could reach it setting Washington up for its first touchdown Cornerback Kendall Fuller nabbed Carrs second interception taking advantage of an underthrown pass intended for Seth Roberts midway through the second quarter Just a few plays later the Redskins found themselves ahead by two touchdowns Pryor Silences Arrowhead Stadium With 44Yard Score Wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr gave his team an early lead after hauling in an bomb from quarterback Kirk Cousins Three minutes into the game Cousins looked to the right sideline and saw a oneonone matchup between Pryor and defensive back Marcus Peters Cousins tested the matchup and saw immediate success Pryor nudged away from Peters just enough to get open without drawing a flag and caught Cousins pass which flew just beyond the outstretched fingertips of Peters Washington would go up 70 and stayed competitive the entire game against

Josh Norman returning Well get more of an official update on Normans status this week as the Redskins return to practice following their bye week Having said that Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said after last weeks game against the Kansas City Chiefs that Norman is currently weektoweek with a rib fracture Norman hinted on Twitter that his return may not be for another month leaving Washington potentially without their star cornerback for the next few weeks Its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Norman said after the Kansas City game Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that If Norman really is out for the next few weeks the Redskins will likely rely on Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill the void opposite Bashaud Breeland and Kendall Fuller in the slot Dunbar originally filled in for Norman after his exit against the Chiefs but the thirdyear Florida product was also briefly sidelined with Moreau coming in for a few plays Now in his third season at cornerback after making the switch from wide receiver as a rookie Dunbar has appeared in 29 regular season games with four starts As for Moreau hes mostly played special teams to date for the Redskins But Gruden said that defensive backs coach Torrian Gray had the UCLA product as one of the highest rated cornerbacks in the 2017 NFL Draft Now the Redskins could see what the 23yearold offers from a defensive aspect early in his career RealMacDaddy asks How are we going forward with the running game We have success but Perine doesnt seem like he can get it done HailMail This has been a question thats been asked quite a bit over the last few months but the answer has remains the same When healthy Rob Kelley remains the Redskins featured back with Samaje Perine spelling the secondyear Tulane product at times Then of course theres Chris Thompson who has gotten off to a hot start as Washingtons thirddown back Through Washingtons first four games of the season Perine is actually the leading rusher with 143 yards to Thompsons 142 and Kelleys 131 This has mostly been due to the fact that Kelley missed the second half of the Redskins games against the Los Angeles Rams and Chiefs while also being inactive against the Oakland Raiders Perine has flashed bigplay potential at times but the 2017 fourthround pick had a late fumble against the Raiders and failed to secure a pitch from Kirk Cousins against the Chiefs The fumble went down under Cousins name but it was Perine who never was able to keep his hands on the ball before it rolled out of bounds Despite a few ball security errors Gruden and the coaching staff are confident Perine can have success in his rookie campaign I think hes still in the process of developing like all young running backs are Gruden said The kid for Kansas City is a special guy Kareem Hunt but Perine is in a spot right now where hes just continuing to get the workload especially if Rob Kelley has got an ankle injury for any due time Hes going to get more and more reps and hes going to get better and better JKStoneberger asks Vernon Davis looks like he has found his youth Is it possible since Garcon is gone that Davis can be a hybrid TEReciever HailMail It seems like theres nothing that can slow down Vernon Davis Now in his 12 th NFL season at 33 years old Davis possesses speed and agility that players 10 years his youth dont even have for their game After being held catchless in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Davis has caught eight passes for 160 yards and a touchdown in Washingtons last three games He followed up a fivecatch 58yard performance against the Raiders with two catches for 89 yards against the Chiefs A 69yard catchandrun moved Davis past Heath Miller 6569 for the 10thmost career receiving yards by a tight end in NFL history And entering Week 5 action his 20 yards per reception paced all NFL tight ends Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said last week Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player He takes care of himself While theres so many positives to Davis game the Redskins still want to get reps for their young receivers in Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and even Ryan Grant So it may be hard to picture Davis role expanding past what it already is a toplevel No 2 tight end option who can fill in for Jordan Reed if needed Sure he can make the tough catches but the Redskins want to get the wide receivers more involved on a consistent basis Theres certainly still a lot of hope that Doctson can fill some of what Pierre Garon left behind when he signed with the San Francisco 49ers Even though Doctson dropped a potential gamewinning touchdown against Kansas City hes beginning to make more plays in the passing game I have no problem with any of them at any given time but I think the more Josh obviously if he can stay healthy gets on the practice field does it in practice the more reps he will get Gruden said Were fine with Josh and where hes at',\n",

       " 7939: 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Being a father has given him a broader perspective about playing football Predictably becoming a father for the first time has given Cousins a better perspective about how to approach his life and football career When you throw a few interceptions and come home from a tough loss I think itsgoing to eat at you a little less Cousins said I think when you re on top of the world after a big win youre going to come home and realize that youre not as big of a deal as you think you are I think thats a healthy thing Cousins said he read Drew Brees book that discussed how the Saints quarterback had better time management after the birth of his son because it gave him incentives to finish certain priorities on time so he could be home longer with his family Ray Wright our old strength coach whos now in San Francisco when I got married said I believe youre not your best self as a player until your married Cousins said A lot of times guys play better once theyre married and Id maybe even say the same thing about having a son I think you could maybe even become a better football player after that happens 2 He would have preferred a later Bye Week but was glad to have time with his son The Redskins received their Bye Week on the early side this season coming after just four games This came in handy for many on the defensive side of the ball that got injured during the Chiefs game but it now means that the team must prepare itself for 12 consecutive weeks without break Ultimately Cousins would prefer to have a Bye Week closer to the middle of the season like they did last year after visiting London but he was also happy to spend the first week of his newborn son Coopers life without his typical work week I think we were fortunate with the timing of our babys arrival that the Bye Week came when it did but its always tough when its so early Cousins said You prefer a Bye Week later in the year when its really a halftime of the season but well take what we can get Earlier in the year I guess like I said we had the benefit with our baby and when you go back and look at the start of training camp and how long weve been going at it it probably is about halfway now Well take advantage of the time we rested and got recharged and were ready to go now During the Bye week Cousins posted a lot of photos of his time with Cooper showing off his dad swag I felt like I had dad swag before I was a dad Im the kind of guy in high school who would wear a braided belt and cargo shorts White socks that came up half way up my ankles Cousins joked I was probably one step away from Velcro shoes and a visor and an oversized polo tucked in Maybe even a Palm Pilot on my belt Actually Kyle Shanahan used to tell me when he saw me in my game uniform he said Kirk your swag is having no swag Thats kind of always been my swag and I guess Ill stick with it But yeah I guess I kind of fit the dad vibe for the most part 3 Hes developed a lot as a quarterback even over the last year Just because Cousins is in his third year as the starting quarterback doesnt mean there are things he isnt intent on improving With each year comes more comfortability and more nuances for Cousins to develop and hone Well Ive developed every area of my game from the end of year two to now in the middle of year six Cousins said Everything from protections audibles understanding the run game reads coverage recognition blitz recognition Just how to handle a 16 game season and how to win in this league how to play on the road Theres so many elements of being a quarterback As Ive played Ive picked them all up and I feel like every year I take another step Cousins has attributed most of his progress to the coaches around him I think most of us need to have great people around us to be successful he said Maybe not the case with every player but most of us do and Im no different Ive been so fortunate to have Mike Shanahan Kyle Shanahan Matt Lafleur those people leading me my first few years And then to have Sean McVay Jay Gruden Matt Cavanaugh Ive felt like has had a big impact on my career and now Kevin OConnell 4 Kyle Shanahan always believed in his potential which has meant a lot to him The Redskins will face some familiar opponents this weekend when they host the 49ers Theres wide receiver Pierre Garon who Cousins knew for his whole career playing for the Burgundy and Gold and then there is former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan The latter played an important role in Cousins young NFL career as he developed at the professional level After providing a list of quarterback coaches and offensive coaches that have impacted his career Cousins pointed out Shanahan for a specific reason Kyle stands out looking back just because the information we have now we didnt have then Cousins said No one knew what was going to happen and Kyle believed in me when it was just potential There was no production I hadnt done anything to earn his belief and he believed in me and Mike Shanahan did too and Matt Lafleur for that matter I think thats when I look back and say Wow those guys knew what they were talking about because I hadnt done anything and they told me I had a lot of potential and could do something I think thats when I look back and then respect their knowledge at the quarterback position and what it takes to play well in this league Cousins had goals that were as simple as making the team knowing that next year was never promised to him Hearing that belief from Mike from Kyle from Matt right away gave me a chance to set my sights a little higher and to expect a little more out of myself and to work for more Cousins said It certainly is a shot in the arm when someone believes in you and that was the case and like I said Ive been fortunate to have that really all the way through my career 5 Cousins is constantly involved in talking with receivers to refine their connections While the offense has steadily progressed injuries to receivers have made things inconsistent Jordan Reed Josh Doctson Jamison Crowder and the full potential of the receiving corps hasnt been able to blossom After every game Cousins makes sure to speak with each of his teammates to go over route concepts that the team missed the previous week Cousins has noticed that all of his receivers care deeply about the details of their games and work actively with him on correcting mistakes and learn what the other is thinking about Theres a lot of precision with these routes the spacing and the timing and the depth and the motions and all that comes with reps and experience Ive been encouraged just because everyone in our offense wants to be on the details Cousins said We really care about the details and want to do it right and so its fun to work with them and coach them up and vice versa I respect them when they have something for me because I understand theyre trying to do it the right way Cousins elaborated on where and how these meetings exist I could be passing Ike Hilliard in the hall and say Hey tell Josh Doctson in his under route to get his shoulders down or it could be me passing Josh in the hall and saying the same thing It could be us in a meeting with Jay saying Hey why are we doing it this way Did we tell Terrelle Pryor Sr that already So its an ongoing conversation throughout the day and because we all love football we all are junkies and kind of eat it up and want to talk ball throughout the entire day',\n",

Redskins win DONT LET PIERRE GET COMFORTABLE IN A FAMILIAR SETTING It will be an interesting site on Sunday when the San Francisco offense takes the field for the first time and Pierre Garon is wearing a No 15 49ers jersey For five seasons 201216 Garon was a mainstay for Washingtons offense In total the former Mount Union product finished his time in Washington in the top 10 in both receptions 376 and receiving yards 4549 in franchise history His 21 touchdown receptions are also tied for 12th most among all Redskins skill players in history While he has yet to score so far in his 49ers tenure hes right on track for another 1000yard season Through five games he has 28 receptions for 379 yards Washingtons cornerbacks even without former AllPro Josh Norman have to be ready for Garons aggressive attitude Hes an exceptional guy he makes plays on the ball and as well he runs his routes hard said cornerback Bashaud Breeland who will slide into the No 1 role during Normans injury Its going to be a good task Im all for it San Francisco may not have the bevy of playmakers at its disposal like Washington but head coach Kyle Shanahan likes to move Garon around to get him into advantageous spots Even if hes asked to run shorter routes or go across the middle Redskins head coach Jay Gruden knows hes still one of the top possessiontype receivers in the game today He is really good after the catch Thats the one thing we really have to make sure that we tackle well when he gets the ball in his hands out in space because he can really run after the catch Gruden said He runs very good precise crisp routes and has got strong hands He does all the underneath stuff He can hit you down the sidelines from time to time so he is definitely their best playmaker Stephen Czarda PREPARE FOR THE YOUNG AND HUNGRY While the 49ers enter Sundays game without a win on their resume the Redskins understand that San Francisco could easily have four wins on the season After losing a rather onesided game in the opener against the Carolina Panthers the 49ers last four losses have been by a combined 11 points And in each of their last two games they were taken out in overtime I know the feeling of being winless and just being anxious to finally get that first win said running back Chris Thompson So theyre going to come out wanting to beat us wanting to upset us at home Despite their failure to secure a win so far this year the 49ers have talent on both sides of the ball Offensively of course Garon is the steady threat on the outside complemented by speedsters Aldrick Robinson and Marquise Goodwin They also have Carlos Hyde at running back as the Ohio State product once again is averaging more than 45 yards per carry Defensively San Francisco is loaded with young talent particularly along the line Arik Armstead DeForest Buckner and Solomon Thomas were all taken in the first round of their respective NFL Drafts Armstead and Buckner both offer unique size coupled with their athleticism as both are 6foot7 and more than 290 pounds So for a Washington offense that could be without Trent Williams and Rob Kelley the team must be ready for a group thats ready to strike They have talent Gruden said We are talking about Buckner and Armstead Solomon Thomas and then they bring Elvis Dumervil off the bench for third down rusher Aaron Lynch is a good rusher So they are very talented without a doubt The linebacker play has been solid and obviously they have safeties out the kazoo Stephen Czarda GET CROWDER AND REED THEIR REDEMPTION Washington has quite a bit of depth at the tight end position and its showed so far this season While veteran Vernon Davis leads the teams tight end receiving yards two other players will look to make an impact on Sundays game Jordan Reed who missed the Oakland game entirely and saw limited action against Kansas City finally appears to be ready to go Jamison Crowder another weapon who has dealt with injuries also seems likely as a major factor against the 49ers I think youll see more of Jamison Crowder hopefully head coach Jay Gruden said He is one of our best skill players We have got to get him more involved in the offense Reed and Crowder have almost identical stats through four games With 14 receptions apiece Crowder 107 yards inched pass Reed 106 yards in receiving two weeks ago Gruden said defenses have been clogging the middle of the field to prevent big plays from Washingtons various tight ends He added that will likely change as the outside receivers improve opening up more opportunities for Crowder and Reed underneath We have a number of guys that we need to get the ball to but it is key for us to just be patient spread the ball and get the ball to the open guy Gruden said Brandon Hill FILLING THE NORMAN VOID In the absence of star cornerback Josh Norman while hes dealing with a rib fracture Gruden and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky will look upon a duo of young cornerbacks in Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill his shoes Dunbar a thirdyear player out of Florida is expected to make the fifth start of his career on Sunday his first of the 2017 season Despite the relative lack of starting experience on the field the 25yearold is not short on confidence He thinks he can cover anybody anytime anywhere Gruden said And thats a great mentality to have as a corner and thats the way he feels Hes been out here at practice covering DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon last year and this year with all these other guys Moreau meanwhile is looking to seize an increased role in Normans absence The rookie has appeared in all four of the Redskins games this season and has recorded six tackles While fans have not seen much of the UCLA product in a regular season setting just yet Gruden stresses the importance of his physical tools in Sundays matchup against the 49ers He has speed Gruden said of his rookie defensive back Dunbar and Fabian both are very very fast and that helps when youre playing against a worldclass sprinter like Marquise Goodwin and Aldrick Robinson Theyre both very very fast So its very important we try to match some speed with speed and those guys can both run Jay Cannon',\n",

but Blade Runner scifi thats my kind of stuff Eventually you can take your kids to that movie but not right now Not right now theyre straight Teen Titans thats all they want to watch That sounds like a fitting title for what theyll become Yeah theyre going to be superheroes or something Astronauts One of the two On a separate topic I still cant imagine what its like to play with a shoulder thats been dislocated How would you describe it Its a little weird Its definitely painful and you feel restricted But for the most part its just about pain Your shoulder is already kind of messed up so if you can deal with the pain its whatever The pain its bad but its a part of football As long as I can play to the level I feel I can play to help the team win then I was alright I just love playing football I wouldnt want to miss any of that As long as it stays locked down and doesnt pop out again Im alright Do you feel offbalance or offkilter Maybe before with my other one my left was a little weird But here we have great athletic trainers great doctors and equipment people They way theyve got it locked down and set up and all the rehab I do makes it feel great It gets beat up but theyre able to bring me back the next day and Im ready to go again Where does the interception you had against Jared Goff rank amongst plays youve made with the Redskins Oh thats number one definitely Last year I didnt really get to play too much on third down or be on twominute drives I feel like you make those kinds of splash plays its something I really always wanted to do ever since college try to make interceptions and sacks big plays that end the game It was good to get one as a Redskin especially in the Coliseum Its something youll never forget I remember earlier this offseason when you told me that your only concern was winning regardless of your role Were you unsure about how much you were going to play or what your role would be this season I kind of had a feeling that I was going to get a chance to play It was really just talking about special teams whatever they need me to do I know that no matter who they bring in no matter who comes at the end of the day its all competition So I knew if it was competing against ZachBrown Will Compton Martrell Spaight whoever I knew it was going to be a competition I was going to give them my best I know theyre going to give me their best At the end of the day it was about winning If Im giving my best every day and you can beat me out then you deserved it and were going to be alright Thats all it was about Its still the same way Even after the Bye Week all you want to do is win no matter what you got to do You had also mentioned that joining the Redskins made you fall in love with football again Has that love continued to grow this season Definitely You spend four years in Tampa You go to the Bears and get cut Ive never been a quitter and always seen it through to the end but that was like probably the first time in my life where I was probably thinking like I can go do something else How deep did those thoughts go I got cut the last day of camp then probably the next couple of days I had my cousins with me in Chicago and I really was just talking to everybody My best friend from college and my frat brother a strength coach at South Dakota he was like Bruh dont let that stuff get you down Come here you can sleep on my couch well train and it worked out But that was really it those 48 hours where I was just thinking Ill go back to school Im going to go coach Im going to help University of Washington Thats not where my mind should have been at but thats why you have a good circle of friends Your family is there for you all of the time Once I came here Jay and linebackers coach Kirk Olivadotti and all the fellas in the locker room it just made me feel like I love football again Even if I wasnt starting because I started my whole life but it was just being on a team where people cared about you coaches are having fun everybodys playing hard I gravitated towards that It made me want to stay here and continue to help this team win Looking back did it seem silly to have that anxiety Yeah I mean it definitely did because Ive never been that type of person but you kind of felt like some of the stuff that happened in Chicago was a little weird the way the situation played out Its a business and youve just got to keep trucking That was one of the big moments in my career I cant believe I thought for a second that I was done or washed up I still feel like I can play All of my friends my mom my dad everybody close to me was like Bro just go train trust me and it really helped me out Now I know I can do whatever I put my mind to Will Compton reads a lot on psychology and mental training Have you always felt like youve been in a positive mental space too Ive always been super optimistic See the good in people Stay positive How tough is that to do Its pretty tough Especially when you get in those situations like in Chicago That was probably the only time ever Even when I was in Tampa we were 214 I went into every game and thought we were going to beat them by 21 points Thats just how I feel I believe in everyone in this organization wholeheartedly Theyre the best that do their job When I went into that dark thinking maybe Im not as good as I think maybe this isnt for me that was tough because that was the first time I ever really felt like that I had never felt negative about a situation that bad where I wanted to give up It changed a lot of stuff for me I started reading more books What did you read I read the book The Art of Mental Training which was a good way to get your mind on how to eliminate bad thoughts and carry yourself like a champion envision yourself doing this and that That helped me a lot The main thing Im Omega Psi Phi fraternity so both of my line brothers were really on me about You cant let this stuff break you youve got to keep pushing See it through Its really what got me through all of that Youll look at yourself in the mirror and know that you gave it your all You reached out to someone on Twitter and gave him tickets in exchange for community service Has social media been your way to stay positive Definitely Its little way to try and get people to pay it forward I always do that for kids who need tickets or something Just do something nice When youre a good person good things happen to you Thats how my dad raised me Youre a good person good stuff will happen to you sooner or later Its something little but you see it it helps them out a lot I didnt even think about how much it would just pay it forward You be the first one to help them move or hold the door for somebody if people start doing little stuff like that thats the start Thats just the tip of the sword It just gets deeper You can get people to be good people to everybody then you never know what can happen Has it been easier to try since theres been a lot of negativity surrounding players over the last month Its always crazy because most of the guys that I know and I interact with every single day are great guys The best dads I know the best husbands I know the best brothers I know so its crazy that people see NFL players in this crazy light Its part of the game You play a violent sport Sometimes youre going to get viewed that way But I think the stuff people are doing in the community the stuff people do outside of football shows what type of people all these guys are It would be easy just to sit at home and not do anything and turn a blind eye to it I feel like a lot of guys are standing up reaching out into the community and helping out behind closed doors not doing it for any certain reason but to help someone out I think that means a lot to a lot of NFL players Youre a laidback guy too Does that stem from growing up on the west coast Definitely Its probably just from my grandpa My whole family is like that laidback Of course theyre going to be tough on you tough love if you need it and I was one of those hardheaded kids that needed it What was your grandpa like He was real cool We had Grandpa Thursdays This was my dads dad Every Thursday night he would invite everybody over all the grandkids and the cousins Hed cook us all a bunch of food for us to hang out together I feel like he was always helping people out in our neighborhood no matter what My granny my moms parents lived four houses down So we would just bounce around I spent a lot of time with them my mom and dad both worked so my grandpa would pick us up on Fridays Me and my friends it didnt matter who I would be with wed go bowling It pretty much came from that just being a cool person everybody loved my grandpa because of that It was like I could be that too help people out smile listen to people when they need to talk to you It goes a long way for people And living in Seaside Calif and then Seattle those are pretty diverse areas Thats one of the reasons why I fell in in love with Seattle You get the same vibes San Francisco Bay Area Northern California people just chilling Nobodys really judging each other people are just chilling Its pretty cool and its something that I just gravitated towards Im glad I made that decision I wanted to go experience new places Youve lived in the Pacific Northwest the Midwest the Southeast and the Northeast now Do you feel fortunate about living in nearly every time zone and region I love it You never really know how people are Where I grew up theres all different types of people Filipinos Guatemalans Polynesians Samoans so its cool to go to other places and see that everybodys the same but everybodys different Its cool to see everyones variations I love it A lot of people dont get that experience Its cool to meet kids in DC go to the middle schools in Tampa and play basketball with the little kids Which coast has the better food I would say the west coast We just got a certain mix When I was in high school we had Aloha Rallies and multicultural lunches Every culture brought its own food You could just bounce around It was pretty much peoples parents and grandparents cooking Definitely get some egg rolls fried rice I think the west coast just because they have a lot of variety The weather is also so drastically different I cant imagine living in Tampa It doesnt rain as long per day Seattle its just those gray gloomy skies all day Tampa it would rain hard for 10 minutes but then its going to be back to sunny and hot Then the alligators Being in Seattle and then going all the way down to Tampa it was the lockout so I didnt really get to Tampa until camp It was hot There was a bunch of bugs but it just makes you grow up as a person Learn on the run What does the next three quarters of the season look like for you and the team I think its just a continuous climb I think guys know where were at We just want to keep getting better everybody wants to keep getting better You take the Bye Week to really identify look in the mirror see what you did I rewatched all the games see where I can get better Just keep getting better one two three each day is a new day I think people see the potential that we have as a team Now its about making it go happen Nobody likes that shoulda coulda woulda stuff What was your favorite tackle so far It was probably one of those on Monday night Coming off a shoulder injury people never know is he going to be My first play I hit the running back and I was like Im alright So that was a good feeling for me like to really hit somebody Its definitely one Ill remember Is there a certain feeling you have when you know youve made a good tackle Its like hitting the baseball on the sweet spot of the bat You cant even feel it but you know you hit it just right hard enough A good tackle you bring your feet arms he goes backwards Its a great feeling There aint nothing like it I asked Ryan Kerrigan this question and he had a good response Whats the strangest thing youve received unsolicited in the mail from a fan It was something weird for your nose or maybe for your head Some new product It wasnt that weird because I tried it and I mean that might work but I was like I dont think you can just put it on your helmet It was like nasal strips or a skull cap At least people are thinking about you I had something cool sent Im a big wrestling fan my little boys wrestle nonstop They think theyre like a tagteam One of the fans he sent me two tagteam champion of the world belts that they wear around That was super cool I always

49ers 24 On the first play of the final frame Chris Thompson moved the chains with a 13yard reception on 3 rd and12 The catch means Thompson now has his second career 100yard receiving game The Redskins would eventually get inside the 10yard line but the 16play drive did not result in a touchdown as second and first down runs were stopped before a third down incompletion Dustin Hopkins would make a 21yard field goal though to push the Redskins back into the lead at 2017 The defense meanwhile allowed just one first down before locking down the 49ers offense to force a punt After a short punt return by Jamison Crowder the offense got the ball back with a little more than eight minutes left in the game with the Redskins up by three Cousins would complete his first two passes of the drive before Samaje Perine moved the chains on a 3 rd and1 run Then on Cousins third pass of the drive the quarterback connected with tight end Vernon Davis for a massive 51yard gain that put the Redskins deep into 49ers territory The 49ers then were called for defensive holding to give the Redskins a new set of downs at the sevenyard line which gave Washingtons offense new life On the new set of downs Cousins called his own number on an option run to get the Redskins another touchdown While Hopkins missed his extra point attempt the Redskins now lead by nine The 49ers would match the touchdown though as CJ Beathard found Aldrick Robinson for a 45yard touchdown with less than two minutes left in the game San Franciscos onside kick attempt was caught by Fabian Moreau and Washington would run the ball three times before Tress Way came out to punt with exactly one minute left The ball would go into the end zone for a touchback While the 49ers would get into Redskins territory a late offensive pass interference call pushed San Francisco back to midfield with 19 seconds left After three incompletions the 49ers went for it on 4thand20 with nine seconds left but Kendall Fuller tallied his second interception of the season to close out the game Third Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 17 San Francisco got the ball to start the third quarter but linebacker Ryan Kerrigan prevented the 49ers from getting a second touchdown when he recorded a timely sack on rookie quarterback CJ Beathard Two plays after the takedown by Kerrigan cornerback Kendall Fuller logged a diving pass defensed The 49ers would however tack on a 52yard field goal make to cut the Redskins lead to seven After a brief appearance by the offense Washingtons defense started at midfield following a big punt return by San Francisco The 49ers would miss a 47yard field goal attempt though after getting into Redskins territory On the drive cornerback Bashaud Breeland suffered a knee injury and his return is questionable Rookie Fabian Moreau took his spot in the lineup opposite Quinton Dunbar who replaced an injury Josh Norman for the game The offense would be on the field for just one play though as a Vernon Davis fumble was recovered by the 49ers After just one offensive play for San Francisco Carlos Hyde punched it in for his second touchdown of the game The extra point was good and the game is now tied Kirk Cousins would get the ball moving with an 18yard run on the ensuing drive following the 49ers touchdown Three plays later on 3 rd down Cousins would find an open Ryan Grant in the middle of the field for an 18yard gain to get into San Francisco territory Second Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 7 Working down the field with several short passes from Kirk Cousins to Jordan Reed and Jamison Crowder the Redskins got deep into 49ers territory before the quarterback found rookie Samaje Perine for a threeyard score The catch was the fourthround picks first career touchdown So far on the afternoon Cousins is 12of15 for 121 yards with two touchdown passes San Francisco would get their first positive moment on the afternoon early in the second quarter but Washingtons defense continued to hold stout to force a third punt for as many 49ers offensive drives this afternoon The Redskins couldnt get much going on the ensuing drive as Cousins was off on one pass that was ruled an incompletion before throwing his first interception since Week 1 on an offtarget deep toss down the right sideline After four punts the 49ers went to rookie quarterback CJ Beathard grandson of former Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard to replace Brian Hoyer The Iowa product would complete 1of4 passes on his debut drive before San Francisco called on the punt unit once again Set up by a 49yard screen pass completed to Chris Thompson the Redskins got into field goal range for kicker Dustin Hopkins who nailed a 48yard field goal attempt Thr 49ers though would score just before halftime as Carlos Hyde punched in a oneyard touchdown on 4thandgoal On the drive safety Montae Nicholson was removed from the game after a scary collision with former Redskins wide receiver PierreGaron one that would knock the rookies helmet off First Quarter Redskins 7 49ers 0 Like they did against both the Raiders and the Chiefs the Redskins first offensive drive against the 49ers ended with a touchdown The balanced attack drove 75 yards in just eight plays as Kirk Cousins completed all four of his passes including a touchdown throw to Josh Doctson while the ground game picked up 18 yards This is Doctsons second touchdown catch of the season as he also hauled in a 52yard score against the Raiders in Week 3 Dustin Hopkins extra point was good too as Washington jumped out to an early 70 lead The 49ers meanwhile could not match the Redskins offense as Washington forced San Francisco to punt after gaining just one first down On that drive the 49ers tried to get Pierre Garon on a big second down reception but Bashaud Breeland and Montae Nicholson forced an incompletion Despite the offense getting forced into a threeandout on its next drive the defense continued to show up early in this contest as they also forced a punt after just three plays On a third down dropback by Brian Hoyer Matt Ioannidis and Preston Smith were among those to take down the former Michigan State quarterback It looked like DJ Swearinger later in the quarter had his first career touchdown on a fumble recovery but Hoyers pass was ruled an incomplete pass Quinton Dunbar made sure the 49ers wouldnt get any momentum though as the thirdyear corner who is starting in place of Josh Norman logged a beautiful openfield tackle on third down Terrelle Pryor Sr would record his third catch of the opening frame

injury bug the defense held on when it counted most In a back and forth fourth quarter the 49ers go one finally chance at a comeback victory with 52 seconds left on the clock While Washingtons improved defense got the upper hand on San Franciscos offense early particularly when Brian Hoyer was in the game the unit was banged up Cornerback Bashaud Breeland knee and defensive lineman Jonathan Allen foot both suffered gameending injuries Cornerback Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett of course wasnt playing either while safety DJ Swearinger briefly exited the contest with a stinger Quickly the 49ers got things rolling against the hampered defensive unit In just four plays San Francisco got to Washingtons 40yard line off two big catches by former Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garon But the receivers aggressive nature would ultimately cost his team their first victory of the season Called for offensive pass interference San Francisco was pushed back to the 50yard line They would never get back into field goal range as cornerback Kendall Fuller iced the game with his second interception of the season on a fourth down throw from CJ Beathard We were just kind of playing the sticks trying to make sure they dont get a first down at the same time trying to protect the sidelines Fuller said Definitely a good play call for the coaches The cornerback added that although the 49ers got into field goal range down just two points the defense never get nervous and never lost confidence We knew it was going to be a dog fight and weve just got to keep on fighting Fuller said 2 Outside of an errant pass that was picked quarterback Kirk Cousins once again was effective for the Redskins For the third time in as many games the Redskins offense scored on the units opening drive After receiving the opening kickoff against the 49ers Cousins drove the offense 75 yards in eight plays capped by an 11yard score from wide receiver Josh Doctson It was the first of three touchdowns on the afternoon for Cousins who also connected with Samaje Perine for a score and scampered in for a sevenyard touchdown in the fourth quarter In total Cousins passes for I think we did a good job as an offense Cousins said I think we moved the football There were a lot of good decisions a lot of good plays made a lot of thirddown conversions in big moments a lot of crucial drives where we had to churn the clock and come away with points So I was proud of the way our offense played today It wasnt perfect there were a couple mistakes but all in all we did a lot of good things Cousins touchdown run early in the fourth quarter was actually the gamewinning score for the Redskins On the option run Cousins pulled the ball back from Perine before running to his right unevaded into the end zone Its always been there because you know I would credit going back to my rookie year with Robert Griffin III here we did it a lot Cousins said Its always going to be a part of our offense because it does give defenses something to think about Kyle Shanahan told me when he left he said Ive learned after working with Robert that this is a really valuable play no matter who the quarterback is and Ill always carry it with me So when Jay Gruden arrived we kept it and valued it and as I started playing it can still be a great play You just have to pick your spots be smart with it call it at the right times and read it correctly and then usually you can get some yards 3 The young players particularly in the secondary stepped up At one of the deepest position groups on the roster the Redskins needed all of their active defensive backs on Sunday Normally of course the Redskins have Norman and Breeland as the starting cornerbacks But Norman missed the entire game with a rib injury while Breeland briefly dealt with a hamstring issue before a knee injury suffered when 49ers tackle Joe Staley rolled up on him knocked the Clemson product out of the contest In their place Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau saw significant reps Even seventhround pick Joshua Holsey logged snaps on the final drive It was the first time he ever played on defense in his nascent NFL career No dropoffs we prepare Dunbar said of the young defensive backs Everybody prepares like starters Coach Greg Manusky helping us through the week helping us during the week to prepare everybody like starters so that when you get in they expect you to play like a starter Swearinger told the defensive backs that theyre only as good as their weakest link In his eyes though the unit has no weak lines The next player up if the next player prepares hes going to be good Swearinger said Perfect preparation prevents poor performance and I tell the guys that all the time and we performed well 4 Chris Thompson and Vernon Davis continue to be the goto targets in the passing game but others had their contributions too On an afternoon in which Cousins completed 25 passes his top two receivers once again were Thompson and Davis While neither found the end zone on Sunday both continued their strong starts to the season Thompson notched his second career 100yard receiving game as the Florida State product became just the second Redskins running back with multiple 100yard receiving games in a season since 1960 In total he caught four passes for 105 yards highlighted by a 49yard reception on a 1 st and22 pass The offensive linemen are all blocking their guys great and Ive been given some oneonone opportunities and just winning those matchups Thompson said Thats pretty much the key to it I had three screen plays today my first three catches And my Oline did a great job downfield Jordan Reed the receivers all those guys did just a great job blocking for me Its on me to make plays and be a playmaker be a difference maker on this team Davis meanwhile avenged a third quarter fumble with a 51yard catchandrun in the fourth quarter in the first game facing the team that drafted him No 6overall in the 2006 NFL Draft Including a 69yard catch against Kansas City Davis has now posted a reception of 50 yards or more in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 56 of the 2013 season as a member of the 49ers 5 After not being able to do anything physical for two weeks Trent Williams played the entire game Originally suffering a knee injury during training camp earlier this year the issue resurfaced two weeks ago against the Kansas City Chiefs Missing four plays in the game Williams did not practice throughout the entire week leading up to Sundays home contest against the 49ers For most such an injury would keep them out for a few weeks But Williams isnt your average player The fivetime Pro Bowler said he knew he was going to be good on Saturday evening Just a few hours later he played all 70 offensive plays for Washington I didnt necessarily feel like myself but thats expected Williams admitted I havent done anything with football in the last two weeks I felt rusty It was kind of hard early trying to fight through the rust and everything but once you start getting in the flow of the game and the adrenaline starts rushing you kind of start to worry about the game more than anything Williams presence was certainly felt as the 2010 firstround pick didnt allow a young and talent defensive line any sacks from his side In total San Francisco tallied just one sack of Cousins For us man we know what weve got hes our leader said tackle Morgan Moses He doesnt have to practice all week but we know hes going to show up on the game Hes just mentally and physically there Thats what you expect out of a Pro Bowl tackle Cousins added that he wasnt entirely sure if Williams was going to play the entire game In the end though the quarterbacks sturdy left tackle was there for him You prepare for the worst and hope for the best and Trent did a great job playing through his injury Cousins said Im a little spoiled having him as a left tackle and when hes in there it makes a big difference',\n",
       " 8478: 'After a strong start the Redskins defense started to bend against the San Francisco 49ers But when it mattered most a banged up secondary made the necessary plays to win the game A win is a win and as safety DJ Swearinger will tell you despite inconsistent play a banged up roster and near devastation thats all that really matters And indeed thats what the Redskins came away with on Sunday afternoon at FedExField beating the San Francisco 49ers 2624 in a game that fluctuated in momentum and emotion Washington began strong lost its grip midway through hung on long enough and then reestablished its hardnosed play with the game on the line and a losing streak to end With less than a minute left and up by two points the Redskins needing the entire list of defensive players to step in and contribute thanks to numerous injuries affecting the secondary once again kept the 49ers from field goal distance in the waning seconds to close out a victory San Franciscos final play a heave towards the sideline with nine seconds left was grabbed by cornerback Kendall Fuller who returned his second career interception a few yards before being mobbed by teammates in celebration solidifying the teams third win after another gutsy performance with a depleted depth chart We know the depth that we have in this secondary Fuller said Everybody can come out there everybody can make plays everybodys smart Thats just how weve got to do it as a group We bend but we dont break Swearinger offered And I told the guys this week in Kansas City we broke We broke I was just putting that out there so that we cant fail again Anytime it is in our hands to win the game weve got to win the game if we want to be a championship defense And we won the game The Redskins entered Sundays contest wellaware of the challenges they were facing Even though the 49ers had begun the year without a victory their talent and lategame energy showed up on tape Washington was also without its star cornerback in Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett needing its backups to play well and stay healthy Much like the teams game against the Chiefs the Redskins preparedness to fill the voids was tested early when Swearinger had to leave the game for a potential stinger The very next play his backup Stefan McClure collided with safety Montae Nicholson and injured his knee and ankle Both eventually returned but it forecasted the kind of day it would be In the third quarter trying to defend a run play 49ers running back Joe Staley made a cut block on cornerback Bashaud Breeland s knee that forced the training staff to help him off the field and he remained sidelined for the game head coach Jay Gruden said afterward he would receive an MRI on MCL on Monday forcing rookie cornerback Fabian Moreau to take over fulltime Without its two best cornerbacks and with San Franciscos offense beginning to find a rhythm with quarterback CJ Beathard who replaced Brian Hoyer in the first half the Redskins had to rely upon a handful of first and secondyear players in the secondary The defense mostly weathered the storm When people go down we still fight Breeland said No matter the changing of the game were still going to fight man I feel like we carry that over next week Itd be good for us Cornerback Quinton Dunbar filling in for Norman led the team with eight tackles and two passes defensed playing tight coverage on wide receiver Pierre Garon throughout and during the crucial waning seconds of the game That was needed after a blown coverage led to a 49ers touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson which cut the lead to two points with just less than two minutes remaining Cornerback Fabian Moreau recovered San Franciscos onside kick but the Redskins offense while it managed to waste the 49ers timeouts couldnt accomplish a first down giving Beathard and co an opportunity to take the lead Throughout the entire week linebacker Zach Brown noted the teams focus on practicing twominute drills and playing under pressure With confidence in a young group of players knowing exactly what it needed to do the defense began to clamp down as the 49ers approached midfield On third down Dunbar batted a pass up in the air that Garon managed to still collect while keeping his knee in bound which was confirmed after review putting the ball at the Redskins 40yard line After an incompletion Beathard targeted Garon again on a slant route that fell incomplete when Brown ran into Garon in coverage That induced a penalty for offensive pass interference a flag that Brown and the defense had anticipated from watching previous games and recognizing the route combination taking shape before the snap I knew the play before it was going to happen Brown said I told DJ Swearinger I said Hey look they may throw it to Pierre Garcon because whenever the tight end is therePierre was cut split so I knew they were going to run a pick and try to give it to Carlos Hyde outside and Garon ran right into me so already knew it was going to be a flag on him because I was guarding my guy I got to have my right of way too I dont blink Dunbar said Like I was saying during the week football is pleasure for me What I went through growing up its fun I just live and play Thats all The play backed up San Francisco to the 50yard line where the defense gained more confidence and stood its ground forcing two consecutive incompletions before Fuller came down with the interception I think they all stepped up Gruden said Youre talking about not a lot of experience back there With Montae Nicholson playing safety Fabian Moreau and you saw Joshua Holsey back there and Kendall Fuller Obviously Quinton Dunbar had a big day today Very impressed with all of them There was a coverage mixup there that gave them a touchdown to get it back to a one or twopoint game but overall I liked the way they competed covered and played It just shows you that even when a star player or a good player goes down weve got the young guys to come in they know what theyre doing theyre going to fill the role Brown said Fuller made a play The defense stood up when it needed to The Redskins kept pace in the division As Swearinger said parts of the game were ugly but the outcome wasnt In a game that needed everyone the Redskins proved everyone was capable Im very confident in all of them linebacker Mason Foster said I practice with them every day I know that if I tell them something if DJ Swearinger tells them something if Zach Brown tells them something theyre going to be on the same page with us like clockwork Of course youre going to have little things messing that up and mistakes but youve just got to keep playing through it and thats what we did I think guys showed their resiliency today',\n",

the Eagles early lead scoring 20 unanswered points to move on to the Divisional Round before eventually winning the Super Bowl September 19 th 1993 Eagles win 3431 The Eagles looked to be on the rise in their third straight win of 1993 Neither team gained an edge in the first three quarters with the score being tied with a little more than nine minutes left in the game An 85yard run by Reggie Brooks put Washington up 3124 and it looked like the Redskins would earn the W but a late filed goal put the Eagles within striking distance With four seconds left quarterback Randall Cunningham found Calvin Williams for a 10yard touchdown winning the game for Philadelphia November 28 1999 Redskins win 2017 OT Rookie Donovan McNabb had already stolen a win against the Redskins two weeks before

Financial Field JWallMVP asks knowing that we lost to the Eagles 1st game of the season now going back to Philly what are the main keys The Redskins are seeking to exact revenge on their NFC East rivals after the Eagles scored a 3017 Week 1 victory at FedExField in Landover Md and it could come down to the quarterback play While Philadelphia struggled to run the ball against Washingtons defense quarterback Carson Wentz made the unit pay multiple times by extending plays On the defenses opening drive of the season it looked as if the Redskins were ready to record a massive third down sack Instead Wentz escaped two different Redskins to launch a 58yard bomb for a touchdown After the game the Redskins spoke of the frustration of not getting Wentz down but admitted theyd learn from their mistakes from not taking down the secondyear quarterback Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays said linebacker Mason Foster at the time We were right there We will go look at it and get it corrected and just keep getting better and try to make this the last one like that Wentzs hot start has extended through the first month and a half of the season as he enters Mondays game with 13 touchdowns to just three interceptions while passing for more than 1500 yards So stopping the quarterback wont be easy especially with uncertainty in the defensive backfield It isnt clear yet whether cornerbacks Josh Norman rib and Bashaud Breeland knee will play Itll be a great challenge because hes playing extremely well said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Theyre 51 for a reason and hes a major part of that Hes got a great rapport with the receivers right now Theyre playing at a high level so our guys will have to step up Thats just the way it is Theres a lot of teams around the National Football League this time of the year that are dealing with key injuries at certain positions and we just had a couple of them at the corner spot So Fabian Moreau Quinton Dunbar theyll have to step up and play well Joshua Holsey Kendall Fuller While Wentz had a strong showing the opener Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins struggled He had three turnovers including two crucial mistakes in the fourth quarter First Cousins threw an interception in the red zone on third down at a time when the Redskins were only trailing by two points Then after the defense held the Eagles to a field goal late the Redskins had an opportunity to win the game with less than two minutes left trailing by only five But on a 2 nd and3 dropback from Cousins the quarterback had the ball jarred from his possession The Eagles grabbed his fumble and turned it into a touchdown Since that performance though Cousins has been among the best quarterbacks in the league Hes thrown eight touchdowns to just one interception in Washingtons last four games Cousins has also been able to keep opposing defenses on their toes by dispersing the ball to multiple targets Six different Redskins have at least 11 receptions on the season I think any time we have a route combination I think he trusts everybody involved in the pattern and hes seeing things pretty clearly getting to his right reads and right progressions Gruden said this week Its all about reading the defenses going through your progressions and the line giving him time and then trusting the guys to make the plays for you Grimm asks hailmail fatrob a go We wont know Rob Kelley s game status until Saturday afternoon when the Redskins complete the week of practices but Gruden did say this week that the running back will return practice after not participating at all last week Kelley of course did not play in last Sundays victory over the San Francisco 49ers as he still wasnt quite at full strength In his place the Redskins once again relied on the combination of Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson The two running backs combined for 56 rushing yards on 25 carries while Kirk Cousins chipped in 26 rushing yards and a score on the ground as well Perine also scored his first NFL touchdown on a threeyard reception from the quarterback Kelley has been slowed by rib and ankle injuries so far this year as he did not play against either the 49ers or Oakland Raiders He was also removed from games against the Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs as well So the only game hes been fully healthy in this year was the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles His return though could help a Redskins offense thats going against the leagues No 1 rush defense as the Eagles allow just 657 yards on the ground per game Thats nearly five yards less than any other team in the NFL The Eagles havent allowed any running backs to come close to 100 yards on the ground and limited the Carolina Panthers running backs to just one yard on 13 carries last week Now if Kelley cant play on Monday night Gruden remains confident that Perine can be effective in the Tulane products place After not recording a single offensive snap in Washingtons first game against Philadelphia Perine has recorded 55 carries for 166 yards over the Redskins last four contest The more opportunities he gets the better he is going to get Gruden said He is not a finished product by any stretch He is a rookie He is feeling himself through it but I am just looking for more decisive cuts by him and more physical runs Thats just what we expect from Samaje and I know he expects that himself',\n",

gone for at least eight weeks of the season The Redskins placed him on Injured Reserve with a Lisfranc injury that he suffered against the 49ers last Sunday and will have to lean on others to fill the void We miss a guy thats willing to communicate with you and willing to get better an unselfish guy and able to take coaching and get better and understand his role and job out there especially when it comes to the field and stuff like that defensive lineman Ziggy Hood said The Redskins feared that Allen could be lost for the entire season because injuries to the Lisfranc can be extremely difficult to rehab especially for a 288pound lineman He could be eligible to return Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals We got better news after the surgery that it wouldnt be as lengthy as some of these surgeries typically are So thats good news but we still have to rehab it head coach Jay Gruden said He is a big man and sometimes bigger guys take a little bit longer but we will wait and see We will just play it by ear and hopefully we see him again but it is up to the rehab The Redskins will likely lean on secondyear defensive lineman Anthony Lanier II who has been on the 53man roster for the entire season but has been inactive for all five games He played in four games last season year before an injury sidelined him for the rest of the year and he will have a daunting task facing an Eagles team that ranks in the Top10 in nearly every offensive category most notably they lead the league in third down conversions Very excited Lanier said of his opportunity You know keeping the pressure on Wentz is going to be big for us so getting everybody together and lets go do this Its bad that we had to lose Allen but we have got a lot of guys on the roster that are going to fill that spot defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said It is not going to fill it totally like Allen would but Anthony has been doing a pretty good job We are going to mix in and out different guys to see what those guys have But Lanier has been improving each and every week and we are looking forward to him getting on the field and playing the game Beside each other Ioannidis and Allen have been sparkplugs for the pass rush creating an interior push that forced quarterbacks to either flee the pocket or get swarmed by outside linebackers Thats also meant that the team has been able to rely on less blitzing letting the secondary stay in coverage and linebackers keeping an eye on running backs and tight ends The Redskins have 15 sacks on the season and they rank 11 th in the league with a 79 adjusted sack rate percentage which factors in sacks per pass attempt adjusted for down distance and opponents according to Football Outsiders Allen was a big factor in those numbers creating pushes and stunts that freed up his teammates to attack the quarterback According to Pro Football Focus Allen leads all defensive tackles with a 131 pass rush productivity mark for players with at least 30 pass rushes Hes also reached 13 quarterback pressures the most of any rookie defensive tackle on just 80 snaps Gruden remains confident in his potential replacements including AJ Francis who the team recently signed to the active roster after he was cut before the regular season Lanier is a different animal Hes a good pass rusher still young Gruden said Francis provides us some more depth as far as the interior as far as nose guard is concerned I dont know which combination we will use come Monday but it is good to get AJ back here We liked him a lot We let him go numberswise and then we are fortunate that he was on the streets so we brought him back The Redskins underneath defensive line coach Jim Tomsula have rotated their defensive line enough this season to the point that everyone has remained fresh throughout the course of games This should continue to help them in chasing down Wentz on Monday night taking more strides as a unit This room is full with a bunch of guys that arent selfish thats willing to put away egos aside play different positions that they normally dont play whether thats me playing nose Terrell McClain playing that fourtechnique and big Stacy McGee playing the fourtechnique and stuff like that Hood said So we got guys doing that are willing to fight for the guy next to him You want to push them to allow them to be better Then youve got a bunch of guys that are willing to do anything to win',\n",

       "dict_values(['Check out the sights from the Washington Redskins locker room after the team defeated the Los Angeles Rams in Week 2 action at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum', 'Besides the fact that the Redskins starters will get a final extended opportunity on the field this Sunday this week has been helpful in getting players and coaches back to a game routine While the first couple of preseason games can occasionally offer a window into how the regular season will play out for a given team more often it extrapolates small amounts of data and churns them through a hype machine that creates a narrative mostly forgotten by the first week in September The third game however otherwise known as the final dress rehearsal for the firstteam offense and defense gives a sizeable chunk of playing time to the starters providing one last chance to find a rhythm before the opener For the Redskins this comes on a Sunday which means that the past several days have functioned like a regular game week In other words in opposition to the previous two games against the Ravens and Packers Redskins players have gameplanned for their upcoming opponent the Cincinnati Bengals like they would a regular season game getting back into the habit of a threeday practice schedule and watching film with their position groups For the first time this preseason theyll actually have an idea of what to expect when they jog onto the field This week is big running back Chris Thompson said We get to focus on our opponent a lot this week and not so much our offense going against our defense getting some really good looks out there We got to see a lot of Cincinnati last year so it helps to be able to go back and look at that film also because these first two games theyve had a lot of injuries and their starters havent put in a lot of time either Its just been big for us to go watch film and look at some things that they do well and just try to find out best way to execute This is a way of saying that all of the panic regarding the slow offensive starts and unproductive run game should be tempered The Redskins havent concerned themselves too much with preparing for opponents in which starters barely play and backups make the majority of highlights Defenses try out blitz schemes and offenses mostly react the best they can Were going to be fine wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr said earlier this week Everyone goes through a process where you dont really break down the defense You look at the Giants for example Did they look any more spectacular than us And their offense is going to be good I dont care what you say So theres little things that youve got to iron outRight now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday That optimism stems from the fact that the Redskins are hoping to have everyone on offense together on the field for the first time since offseason practices as tight end Jordan Reed returned from the PUP list earlier this week and Josh Doctson looked sharp in his limited action against Green Bay Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh said Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter Aside from getting in sync on the field for an extended amount of time the week of preparation from a filmwatching and installation standpoint remains important The majority of training camp is spent watching tape of teammates which only helps so much With a full week of studying an opposing team players start exercising their mental muscles again adjusting to the routines of the week Just like anything else you take off from practice or if youre away from the game for a little while you come back youre a little rusty have to get your feet under you and just like watching film tight end Vernon Davis said We watch film all the time in training camp we watch each other we watch the plays so it all comes together its not much of a difference its just that youre getting in that habit getting in that room where youre accustomed to doing those things The same goes for the coaching staff which has shuffled around a bit with the promotion of Cavanaugh who has learned how to delegate certain responsibilities to other coaches and given them a good idea of how the regular season will function day to day Its been helpful for the players too I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Cavanaugh said Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the real things going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff Its hard to appreciate the impact of establishing a routine over results but the Redskins are hoping the latter will come because of the former Theres still some time to fix things Cavanaugh said and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes', 'Entering his fourth year with the Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy has never been more comfortable and confident in his career As he prepares for another season McCoy reflects on his time in Texas going through adversity and taking pride in an unheralded role How cool was it to have both of your daughters watch you at training camp this year It was cool It was the first time my family had come to training camp have two little girls and that was a nice breakup to camp see them after practice let them run around for a little bit Kids are such a blessing Its fun to let them see their dad at work I spend so much time here kind of get a glimpse of what I do even though theyre not really old enough to understand yet its just fun to have them around So that was the first time they both saw you on the field Yeah I think so Whats it like having two daughters now Its awesome its work Kids are great but they require a lot of time My wifes a saint she does a great job with them The time that I do get to spend with them I cherish it And you had a full offseason to see your second daughter grow up Yeah I was there for all the dirty work Whens the last time you had to buy yourself a drink in Austin Texas Not very often People in Texas are great Its pretty neat to be able to go back there for a month or so during the offseason and see family and friends and Austins a great place It makes me feel pretty special the way people feel about me there Its pretty cool Do you still feel like a celebrity when youre there I guess a little bit I dont really look at it that way I try to be involved in the community there and here as much as I can My wife and I do a lot for childrens hospitals Im a pretty laidback guy I stay out of the scene as much as possible Playing in the NFL were already in a glass box so the offseason is a time where I can relax and just spend some good family time and stay out of the spotlight Id imagine its hard to do that down there right Yeah anywhere you go you get recognized Thats nice What made you commit to the University of Texas Well I grew up in Texas I always kind of felt that if I ever had the chance to go play at UT that I was going to do that Late in my high school career I got the offer and loved Coach Mack Brown and it was a dream come true for me I really didnt have any doubts thats where I was supposed to be Its such a different city than the rest of Texas Yeah the perception of Texas is a little different and then you go to Austin and youre like Whoa I didnt know this was really Texas Its a great place Its pretty hill country lots of water You can pretty much find whatever you want there You finished in the Top3 Heisman vote two times in your college career Did you ever have any bitterness about missing out Maybe I thought I may win it the first year 2008 that I got invited The second year I wasnt all that concerned because we were playing in the National Championship and that really was my ultimate goal anyways Looking back I got no regrets It was cool to be honored Football is a team sport man its a team sport in college its a team sport in the NFL Guys play well around you and you play well then generally youre going to have some success It wasnt anything I did I was part of a good team What was it like then jumping right to Cleveland You went from big man on campus to backup in a totally new environment Probably the biggest challenge of my life was that transition from college to pro I think the thing that is probably the most challenging for me was for the first time in my life I had not been healthy I had major shoulder issues From that hit in the championship game against Alabama Yeah issues to where didnt know if I was going to get drafted I went from thinking I was going to get drafted pretty high to not even knowing Thats a pretty big emotional ride there Then I go to Cleveland and there was no lack of effort or how bad I wanted to be successful there It just didnt work out for a lot of different reasons I just took it on the chin and tried to bounce back and now Im in a place where I feel confident I feel comfortable and I know where Im supposed to be Right now I feel like Ive grown up a lot since I first came into this league from that standpoint How do you mean I feel like Ive learned a lot about how this game is played Ive had the ability to sit back these last couple of years and watch and learn a whole lot of things and evaluate and figure out if Im given this opportunity again how am I going to handle it Im in a much better position now mentally and physically to handle that So yeah its been quite the journey but I feel Im where Im supposed to be right now What did you take away from your time in Cleveland that you still use today I took away a lot Ill never forget some of the things that happened in Cleveland whether you want to use that as motivation or you want to use that as a chance to learn and evaluate what went on I think in a lot of different ways Ive grown to channel some of the things that went on there and use it in a positive way and again Im happy with where I am now and I always prepare to do my best and answer the call if needed Is that from a football perspective or a personal growth one I think both I think from a football standpoint and also just a life standpoint Really before I came into the league I hadnt faced a whole lot of adversity had to bounce back and pick myself up from failure and things not going the way you want it to I think Ive just grown up a lot in general I dont think theres any situation that will come that I wont be able to handle When you faced that adversity did you have someone to lean on Yeah Ive got people around me that I feel like always shoot me straight From a football perspective I just had to really dial in on my job and my responsibilities Im not a better athlete than everyone else anymore Ive got to learn how to play the position and all the things that come with that I dont think theres any place Id rather be than right where I am now because I feel confident in what we do as a unit as an offense I feel like I can run that show I was in five systems my first five years in the league where I didnt know the intricacies of things that were going on Thats a tough thing playing quarterback Here Ive had three years now not a whole lot of experience on the field some but Ive really had a chance to speak the same language for this long and feel pretty confident about that And thats what you wrote about in The Players Tribune last year Is writing something that interests you after football That was fun to do that I kind of go about my business as professional as I can and try to be the same person every day but at the same time when The Players Tribune approached me about that I felt like it wouldnt be a bad idea to let people who always ask me to let them know Heres what Im doing heres where Im at Just because of being a backup Yeah and I think at this point in my career I hope for an opportunity at some point But at the same time Im thankful for where Im at learning how to lead when Im not on the field and being around guys every day and trying to help us win games Thats a challenge in itself for me but I do feel like I bring that to the table and I mean if anything Ive learned you just never know in this league whats going to happen and the best thing you can do is always be prepared Thats kind of my approach every day Because you never played a snap last year in the regular season did you get antsy I think you do get a little bit antsy As the weeks go by and as the season goes by you get halfway through the season its been three months since youve really played real football I think at that point its even more of a mental approach to coach yourself up keep grinding keep doing the extra stuff that youve done Maybe grab some receivers at the end of practice if theyre not gassed and work on some timing but thats all part of this game you know So how much do you cherish these next two games then I certainly dont take it for granted I think what the preseason allows me to do is realize this game is fun You play with guys you may or may not be playing with during the season But also look at it as a chance to help those guys to make a name for themselves help those guys make some plays And again as I mentioned earlier this is the ultimate team sport It takes 11 guys every time I want to be able to do my job as good as I can each play and hope that Im doing enough that the guys around me are doing their jobs and we can go score some points I look forward to preseason With that being said how much stock can you put into these games especially if you have a tough outing one day Its tough man Every time you want to go out on the field you want to put your best foot forward You want to play well I think theres a lot of things I did well against Baltimore theres a lot of things I need to clean up I think just as a unit overall we all gotta clean up We just gotta be a little more efficient and learn from some of those things When you think about Kirk Cousins ahead of you and the unpredictability of his upcoming offseason does it give you any consternation I think from being in the NFL for the last seven years if theres ever been a time where I have just been locked in on one day at a time its now because you just never know Kirk has played great the last couple of years I think hes going to have another great year The offense by the time we get to the season I think were going to have a pretty solid identity of who we are and what were trying to do I know theres high expectations in the locker room so even though Im not on the field Im part of that and Im proud of that I gotta do my part that if something does happen I need to come in and play a couple of games we dont miss a beat Thats what I take pride in Every day Im doing what Im supposed to do to be ready for that moment There may be other ways to look at it but for me thats the way Im going to approach it I heard you and Kirk both went to the Coldplay concert a couple weeks ago too Yeah it was cool Nate Sudfeld went too It was weird to do that during training camp but it was fun Who sang the most out of the three of you Oh Kirk and Nate for sure I didnt know many Coldplay songs I was listening to them on the way there so I could get familiar with them but Kirk and Nate knew all the songs So you just leaned on them Yeah I just leaned on them And are you giving Kirk any fathering advice with their baby due soon Yeah hes getting close Yeah hes asked me a little bit Im sure most of those questions are going to come when the babys here Theres always so many things with your first child youre just like I dont know what Im supposed to do Im sure those conversations will heat up a lot once the baby comes', 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On TE Jordan Reed LB Junior Galette and LB Ryan Anderson Theyre going to suit up in pregame and well see where they are Reed looks very good Junior had another good day today Anderson didnt do much On if anyone has been ruled out yet No On if he will hold starters out for the fourth preseason game and if he has determined how much they will play on Sunday Correct How much am I going to play them Sunday I dont know play them probably be a half at least At least a half Maybe end of the third quarter well see how we do On the value of having a regularly scheduled week Its been a good week good preview of how its going to be like in the regular season Youre right from preparation to days off to WednesdayThursdayFriday practice tomorrow well have a walk through at Andrews Joint Base Andrews and play Sunday So itll be good having an afternoon game on a Sunday Its good work for us against a good team On practicing at Joint Base Andrews tomorrow Its great man Its just a small token of our appreciation You know its great to do that Weve done that every year since Ive been here and they did it before I was here I guess So its great to get over there shake some hands show the respect that we definitely have for the military On who he hopes will dress for Sundays game You know what Im hoping that they all dress up and play but at the end of the day its up to the trainers and that player So I leave it up to them I try not to get my hopes up on a certain guy or a group of guys I just try to wait and see how theyre doing At the end of the day their health is the most important thing We all need the work coaches included on game day But we have to make sure theyre healthy also On if there is a possibility Galette andor Reed could play in the fourth preseason game No On if the value in playing Cincinnati is lessened given his familiarity with the team Its still the same You know Im familiar doesnt mean theyre familiar So we have to get them schooled up on what they do and some tendencies and try to attack them that way both offensively and defensively Trying to give them a picture of what to expect and see how they execute On if the receivers will have enough time to work with QB Kirk Cousins before Week 1 I hope so I think theres a lot of teams going through that with new receivers on new teams You know were going to utilize every second of the day we have outside and then inside the meeting rooms and Im sure theyll do some extra on their own time But I think being together as long as they have since OTAs and training camp got four preseason games in or three I think theyll be in good shape On if he scripts the first few plays of preseason games Yeah we give them a little first group of plays were going to expect to call early in the game so they get familiar with them And defense we will go over the calls and just get used to the calls and all that stuff at nightly meetings Offensive Coordinator Matt Cavanaugh On the difference in QB Kirk Cousins approach this year Even if he decides to grind a little less hes still grinding Hes got a nice schedule Hes got every minute accounted for Hes got a routine of how he studies an opponent everything starting from late Monday starting to look at tape looking at defensive scheme their personnel Tuesday getting a little more in depth whether hes doing it here or at home on his iPad and then obviously Wednesday we start installing a plan So hes still putting plenty of time in but I think he is a little more relaxed but hes never going to be satisfied and thats kind of what we want out of him Its a position that you cant ever think youve got it all figured out On how similar the preparation was this week to a regular season game Thats a great question We actually took this week as a mock regular season week so our preparation was pretty scheduled We simulated a typical Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then obviously tomorrow the last day before we play So it was kind of a dry run because of a couple of changes on the staff just for guys to get used to how we do it and that was a good reminder what the season is going to be like because it becomes a grind for us too I think we adapted really well We got a lot of work done we got the things installed on time that we needed to install And then a reminder that its the preseason is just you know its the third game of the preseason Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter On if anything stuck out to him about being in a new position on staff From a routine standpoint no because Ive been here for two years and we didnt change the routine much It was just assigning some responsibilities that were someone elses and now a new guys doing it and me included So my time was a little more busy being accountable for the whole plan but I dont think there was major changes to what were doing and how were doing it On questions hed still like to have answered about the offense Listen we as an organization and certainly as an offense expect to be productive every time we go on the field and we werent The first game we had two threeandouts and that was pretty much it Last week it took us a little while to get started and then we had a nice twominute drive and looked better but we have high expectations We want to be more efficient running the ball We want to be more solid in protections We want to be accurate throwing balls and guys getting open So thats a focus of ours every day we go out You can always say Well good thing its the preseason because we havent been sharp for a couple of quarters until the second quarter of the last game we kind of picked it up a little bit But we need to go out and start fast That builds confidence that were going to do things the right way and were going to have it expected all the time Theres still some time to fix things and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes On if this weeks preparation serves like a dress rehearsal for the regular season It does Its very much mirrored what our normal week is like Our meeting time was extended a little bit Qe were more detailed in the preparationWwe did segments so on Wednesday we put in our base first and seconddown plan with different personnel groups Thursday we did our third downs and then today we did our short yardage goal line and red zone and thats pretty much our routine for the week I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the routine is going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff On how deep into the playbook hes able to go in preparing players for preseason games Another great question Because its still the preseason particularly the first two games we really didnt narrow down a lot We kind of went in thinking everything weve practiced all through OTAs and training camp is still available to us Now that were game planning a team obviously that gets cut down so the number of plays wed carry in certain situations would be fewer with a lot more detail I think theyve felt like this week they had a chance to really zone in on what was going to be expected what plays to expect when to expect to them what their responsibilities were and that should help with execution On game plans being vanilla early in the preseason I dont know about know vanilla Quite honestly the first preseason game when you know your starters are only going to play half a dozen plays maybe 10 plays youre really more focused on the second and third groups and what can they handle Your starters come out they know the playbook so you kind of take some of that stuff away and then you get a little more vanilla if you will Last week we had a decent plan It wasnt a normal schedule but we put in a decent plan and it took us awhile to get rolling but we finally figured it out and then this week a lot more detail On Cousins growth with the uptempo offense He is probably a lot more prepared to do it now The more you are in an offense and the more you understand all the verbiage and nuances you run plays and you get different looks You might run the same play five times in a game and get a completely different look a different front a different pressure a different coverage and youre adjusting on the fly I think all that lends itself to him being more exposed to what might happen on a play So if we do something that is uptempo and the ball is snapped quickly his recognition should be a lot quicker and I think he is getting to that point We all as a group are going to put a game plan together we think will help us win the game whether its slowing the game down speeding it up throwing it every down running every down it really doesnt matter as long as we are all in agreement and we understand what our objectives are and what we have to do to win On the benefit of going uptempo Well the other thing it does is it makes the defense slow down a little bit too They have less time to react Youre going right to the line of scrimmage calling the play we are in a twominute mentality so we are going right to the line of scrimmage The quarterback is hand signaling he is calling out protections The defense has to get their call in they cant disguise coverages as well They dont want to get caught offguard Its hard from the sideline I think defensively to get a pressure on you know signaling pressure Some teams do it most dont So I think from that standpoint you kind of slow them down a little bit just by getting to the line of scrimmage real quick On the benefit of having the top four pass catchers on the field with Cousins on Sunday Well obviously they are all very talented guys so we want them out there We are also of the mindset that again this is not for real yet I mean we are playing a game and we want to play well and get a win but our opening game is almost two weeks away so we want to be ready for that We are not going to expose somebody in the preseason that we dont think is ready If they are ready to play and we get the OK from the medical people and the organization says lets play him well play him But I think most of those come down to gametime decisions They are all progressing well They have all been on the field for the most part the last few days and we are excited about that On C Chase Roullier Im not doing a lot of work with him but Bill Callahan is wearing him out Bill is putting in all the time necessary to get him prepared Now he has been here he is learning the offense He was getting a lot of work with the second group So he has just stepped up a notch He has been in with the ones I think his communication is getting much better He and Kirk are starting to feel each other out you know understanding Here is couple of my cadences that we have to master I want you to be real precise with your protection calls Remember I can always trump you and make a different call so listen what I am saying So those are things that he was getting to a real comfort level with Spencer Long and now he has got a younger guy in there who we have to feel him out too So from that standpoint it could happen at any position Any of the 11 positions somebody could go down and somebody else has to go in and we expect guys to come in and perform I am confident that Chase will do a fine job', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays preseason matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals Friday Aug 25 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center

finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fames Class of 2018 Bobby Beathard has earned every bit of attention that has come his way After being inducted as the 49 th member of the Redskins Ring of Fame last fall the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Friday announced that Beathard has been named a contributor finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fames Class of 2018 Beathard was selected by a fivemember group from a rotating ninemember subcommittee of the Selection Committee Like modernera candidates Beathard must earn a minimum of 80 percent of the Hall of Fame Selection Committees vote They will meet on Feb 3 2018 one day before Super Bowl LII in Minnesota to consider which of the finalists will be selected for the Hall of Fames next class of inductees Beathard originally entered the NFL working in various capacities with the Kansas City Chiefs Atlanta Falcons and Miami Dolphins before joining Washington as the teams general manager on Feb 24 1978 Over the course of the next 11 seasons Beathards Redskins accumulated a 10563 regular season record The teams winning percentage of 625 was tops in the NFC and secondbest in the NFL During that time the Redskins also collected the leagues best postseason record going 113 in the playoffs with three Super Bowl appearances and two titles The Redskins would win a third Super Bowl after the 1991 with many of the players on that roster brought in by Beathard Beathard was in constant pursuit to collect the best possible talent available leaving no stone unturned With a passion for talent evaluation Beathard spent week after week scouting for players that could fit Washingtons roster Idcome in to Redskins Park Monday and look at the film with the coaches and then Id be on the road and get back Friday Beathard said last year I had an agreement with the owner that I would come back I didnt stay out for college games because wed always get the film in those days and tapes later of those games so we could review them more closely rather than watching six players in a game when you dont get to rerun it when youre there live Beathard also used each and every round of the NFL Draft to find players that could come in and contribute in some capacity Well my philosophy was always when we go out to the college and look at the tapes the agreement we had with our coaches was once we draft these guys forget the round number Beathard said When they all come from training camp you treat them the same like theyre all first rounders and we would just evaluate the players Like Darrell Green for example We had him way higher than the last pick in the draft last pick in the first round but we were worried about somebody taking him But at the same time we are also thinking his size would keep a lot of teams away from him and it did In the last three years Bill Polian Ron Wolf and Eddie Debartolo Jr have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame through the contributors route', 'The Redskins running game hasnt quite found its groove thus far in the preseason but Sundays game against Cincinnati will provide the best dress rehearsal of the preseason Orchestrating a successful run game is like putting together a rock band Youve got to be in unison head coach Jay Gruden said Wednesday All six seven eight nine 10 guys have got to be in unison and we just havent been right when the ones are in thereYes its just preseason footballs version of the dress rehearsal but the Redskins running game has been off key Through two games starting running back Rob Kelley has carried the ball 13 times Hes gained 12 yards Rob Kelley hasnt gotten many good looks Gruden said simply Other guys came in there we got Samaje Perine some good looks and he had some good hits Grudens right Perine was indeed effective rushing for 45 yards on eight carries as the secondteamers took the field in the second half of preseason game No 2 against Green Bay However the first teamers havent gotten it going on the ground yet The cause for concern is understandable considering Washington ranked 21stin the NFL in rushing yards per game last season On top of that the Redskins could potentially be without starting center Spencer Long for the beginning of the regular season as he recovers from a minor knee injury But on the other hand the reason Gruden and his players are answering run game questions is because of 12 carries by Rob Kelley roughly just a halfs worth of work in a regular season game When the Redskins did run the ball in 2016 they did so effectively averaging 45 yards per carry the ninthbest mark in the NFL Im not really concerned no Gruden said in his press conference after the Green Bay game I know the guys we have up front and I know offensive line Coach Bill Callahan and I know the runners that we have so Im not concerned We do have to execute better We have to put them in better situations Maybe well look at the calls that were calling but for the most part Im not concerned really Gruden obviously wont be pushing the panic button in August but the importance of a successful run game was paramount to the Redskins in 2016 When they had success on the ground they ran the football more often When they ran the football more often they won more often Kelley made nine starts in 2016 for Washington When he had at least 15 carries the Redskins were 401 Less than 15 carries the Redskins were 04 For better or worse Kelley has the numbers attached to his name But the Redskins offensive line has plenty of talent as does the tight end group and they expect success too It takes all 11 players on the field at one time right tackle Morgan Moses said Its not one position weve got to come together and get it working Obviously in the second half against Green Bay the second group got the ball running a little bit So theres capability of doing that Weve just got to go out there and show it The Redskins next test comes against the Cincinnati Bengals Sunday A middleofthepack rushing defense in 2016 Cincinnati has an aggressive front seven that could cause issues if the Redskins dont execute Theyre just a physical sound football team running back Chris Thompson said We played them last year ended up in a tie We can look back at that game from last year and take some things that we did wrong some things that we did right and carry it into this game With the fourth preseason game most likely scheduled as a rest day for the starters Sunday against Cincinnati may be the last chance for Washington to find its running rhythm before taking the stage Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles You know Ive said this before when the run game doesnt work its not one guy Sometimes its tight end sometimes its a tackle sometimes its a back sometimes its the center Gruden said So weve just got to get everybody on the same page Weve just got to keep at it Its all about practice and working at it and getting better', 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda breaks down

after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win STAY IN RHYTHM The Redskins firstteam offensive unit got off to a slow start against both the Baltimore and Green Bay before finally scoring a touchdown on a long drive against the Packers last Saturday Getting the ball just before the twominute warning quarterback Kirk Cousins marched the offense 78 yards down the field on 10 plays capped by a fouryard touchdown reception from wide receiver Jamison Crowder on a 4 th andgoal play just before halftime I do think we got in a rhythm in that twominute which helps Cousins said Plays were working and sometimes that can feed the next play Weve been pretty good when we get in a nohuddle and just have an up tempo to our offense thats been good for us We didnt get behind the chains We were I think for the most part in secondandmedium or thirdandmedium We didnt put ourselves in a lot of tough situations of thirdand12 or thirdand15 I think it was good to have that drive but weve all acknowledged that so far this preseason we havent been good enough for what we want to do this regular season Were excited for the chance on Sunday to start trying to put our best foot forward and put a better product on the field Cousins and Co played the entire first half against the Packers and it could be the same case this Sunday against the Bengals as is normally the case for the third preseason game One way in which Washington could get into a better flow is through the hands of wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr In the first two preseason games Pryor has caught one pass for 11 yards on three targets This week the pair stayed out at practice 30 minutes after it was completed to work on their timing As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time TIME TO STEP UP ROOKIE With Spencer Long currently sidelined after undergoing a minor procedure on his knee this week the Redskins will ask rookie sixthround pick Chase Roullier to take over the reins at center It is certainly a step up for Roullier as hes transitioned from a lateround pick at a small school to starting in the NFL in the matter of a few months But hes ready for the challenge It worked pretty well Roullier said of his work with the firstteam offensive unit Just continuing to learn the offense the best I can so that I am able to be more comfortable with my calls that Im making out there Its definitely something I need to continue to work on Ive had some errors in the last couple of games and its something Ive been focusing on practice Roullier also benefits from having a veteran offensive line around him along with Pro Bowl quarterback Kirk Cousins who said Roullier is very intelligent Hell be tasked with guiding an offensive line against one of the leagues more aggressive defenses He can pass protect I think thats a strength of his his ability to hold up in pass protection Cousins said Theres going to be growing pains Thats understandable but its exciting to see potential when its there and its certainly there with Chase Hes a good teammate a class act so Im excited to work with him Were going to throw him in the fire against the Bengals and see what he can do Im going to do all I can do to help him making protection calls and trying to be decisive so he doesnt have to think too much But Im excited to get him out there and see what hes got SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE RETURNING PLAYERS The Redskins could be at near fullstrength on Sunday as tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Junior Galette returned to practice this week while wide receiver Josh Doctson increased his activity For Galette it could mark his first game in a Redskins uniform since first signing with the Redskins in 2015 The 2015 and 2016 campaigns resulted in seasonlong Injured Reserve stints due to torn Achilles while he was sidelined against the Ravens and Packers with a hamstring injury Gruden said on Thursday that hell be a gametime decision against the Bengals Its been two years so now its getting to the point where its like a movie thats supposed to be released and keeps getting postponed Galette said with a smile And youre like Man Then weve got Jay Gruden here talking about Youre just a tease You know hes kidding around but at the same time youre like I want to go out there and prove that I am everything they expect me to be As for Reed he was activated off the ActivePhysically Unable to Perform list after spending all of training camp on the sideline with a toe injury He was a full participant in practices this week His presence on the field alone significantly alters the landscape of the offense particularly one that is looking to end the preseason on a high note Jordan has unique movement skills and then because hes often lined up in a way where hes being covered by safeties and linebackers and nickel corners he creates matchup issues said Cousins If you want to put your best corner on Jordan Reed thats one option but then now youre opening a door for whoever else is out there a Josh Doctson a Terrelle Pryor a Vernon Davis so on and so forth SHOW EM WHAT YOU CAN DO MASE For the second week in a row the Redskins will have Mason Foster guiding the defensive unit as the Mike linebacker with Zach Brown serving as the Moe linebacker Last week the pair started together and totaled a combined five tackles I think he is just a physical cat in there said Redskins defensive coordinator Greg Manusky From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit Manusky added that perhaps the biggest asset of having Foster and Brown together is their ability to cover the entire field Thats why I like both of them right now Manusky said Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the preseason', 'Download a PDF of the Redskins 2017

DJ Swearinger Its a very competitive period down there oneonones receivers vs Dbacks And its a great route You know the whole thing about it is defensive backs have got to make it a perfect throw and a great catch Fortunately it was a great throw and a great catch for Jordan and Kirk DJ was right there had great coverage But yeah its great to have him back On the health of Reed and LB Junior Galette Jordan looks fine He looks good You know I still want to see how hes doing tomorrow and then obviously Saturday and Sunday see how he does in pregame warmup but he looks very good Very crisp very fast very sudden like he always is which is good Junior hes been doing more and more each day and I think thatll be a gametime decision On LB Ryan Anderson Same thing Same thing He did a little less today but were going to keep getting him checked out and were not going to push the issue unless he has full strength full range of motion and full strength Right now he doesnt have full strength Hes close though very close On if C Chase Roullier is preparing to start at center in Week 1 Were preparing Chase like he needs to go You know I think getting Spencer Long back were hopeful even if it could be in a backup role if hes not 100 percent ready So theres a good chance there also So we have a couple different options But the big thing is to get Chase ready to go and take advantage of the reps hes getting And hes done that hes done a nice job We just brought another center in here for depth you know we need for Sundays game and for the game against Tampa Well take a good look at Lucas Crowley and see how he does On the inside linebackers and the status of that position group Where do we stand Right now were starting with Mason Foster and Zach Brown You know thats a starting point And then obviously Martrell Spaight and Will Compton will get plenty of reps and then youve got Nico Marley and Zach Vigil and then obviously Josh HarveyClemons So we have a good stable there We kind of moved Pete Robertson to outside backer when all our outside backers got injured So hes getting some reps as a pass rusher and hes doing a good job On what he likes about Mason Foster at Mike linebacker I think you know Mason played well last year He really did And hes a smart player and hes very physical So we like his physicality Hes healthy and hes playing well On the nickel corners I think right now Kendall Fuller is probably our nickel corner if we had to start today Joshua Holseys doing an excellent job though you know For a rookie a seventhround pick hes surpassed expectations by far Hes done a good job both outside and inside So those two guys are really the ones were counting on On his level of concern potentially starting a rookie at center Yeah seems like weve had a little rollercoaster ride at center since Ive been here Kory Lichtensteiger was here and then he got hurt We had to try Josh LeRibeus and last year we had some issues early on so I think we just have to get Chase Roullier ready We drafted him for a reason Hes a true center from Wyoming and did a good job last year at Wyoming but he is a rookie But hes a very smart guy and hes learned a lot Coach Bill Callahan has done an excellent job with him If he has to play I think hell be ready He has a couple major obstacles at Philadelphia Fletcher Cox and Tim Jernigan there inside and they have some good pass rushers so itll be a great test for him You dont ever like to thrust a guy into the fire but we think hes a mature guy and if he has to play hell play If Spencer Long is ready to go itll be great but Chase is mature and I think he can handle it On the rotation at center during the past few seasons Its difficult because the centers the one who makes all the calls presnap Hes the one that communicates and youve got to have a smart center You want an athletic center you want a big center At the end of the day youve got to have a center that number one theyve got to get the snaps back and theyve got to be able to communicate Then theyve got to be able to finish blocks and be able to get up on the next level and pass protect and all that good stuff Theres a lot on a centers plate especially for a rookie But like I said Chase can handle it Weve had to mix and match different centers since Ive been here but we just have to deal with it On if he has adjusted the reps for firstteam offense in practice Oh yeah were trying to get as many reps as we can without wearing them down Yesterday we had about a 17play drive to end practice which was good to get them out there and stay on the field and were trying to get more and more together Very important like you say once you get everybody back Still its important for Kirk Cousins to get as many looks as he can get so well try to do the best we can without wearing them out but get them a lot of reps On how important QB Kirk Cousins ability to help Roullier at center is A lot a lot I think earlier in Kirks career it might have been a little bit more of an issue but I think now this stage Kirk feels a lot more comfortable with the protection calls and hell help out a lot The big thing is initially getting the calls right and I think Chase has done a good job so far out here Its going to be a great test for the Bengals Defensive Coordinator Paul Guenther and the Bengals they give you a lot of different looks double As they give you the odd looks they give you spinner looks threedown fronts fourdown fronts all of them So it will be a great test for us Defensive Coordinator Greg Manusky On the combination of Mason Foster and Zach Brown at inside linebacker I mean were going back and forth all the time during practice with Mason and with Comp Will Compton and then with Zach and even Martrell Spaight We are going through a process thats the preseason right now Thats why I like both of them right now Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the preseason On what Foster brings to the Mike linebacker position I think he is just a physical cat in there From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit On if he can make sense of Defensive Line Coach Jim Tomsulas rotation along the defensive line No Ive known Jimmy for a long time and I just let him do whatever he wants to do pretty much From our aspect we want to see players play at different positions because during the season you never know you might need a backup nose that has played end and vice versa So switching those guys inside and out has been a good scenario because they have got to learn left defensive end they have got to learn right defensive end they have got to learn a little bit of nose as well We are just tinkering with it figuring out what is going to happen Here in the next couple weeks we will figure it out On when he changes from evaluating the whole roster to focusing on preparing the starters I think in this third preseason game I think thats kind of the avenue that we are sticking with but across the board you never know Some guys get injured or sometimes other guys do show up from a previous game they didnt play as good You know every game is different for every player because sometimes they have had great performances and other times they just didnt just for some reason We are honing in on it of course with the players that we have got going into this third preseason game Rotationally wise Jimmy up front I dont know maybe the second series is totally different We do have a plan in place and we kind of know where we are going to try and alter it On the value of having a nose tackle that can play in the nickel package as well I think that is a big plus That is what we are trying find out I am just saying that sometimes during the preseason games at the end of the game we want to see them against a little bit better competition too So switching those guys is a point that we are trying to figure out On his philosophy on where CB Josh Norman will lineup in his defensive system I think certain corners are sometimes really relaxed on the right side and some are on the left and sometimes if you flip them at times it actually messes with their head It depends on the individual If he feels comfortable switching sides then that is fine All of a sudden if he feels like we have a threat on the outside that we have to have Josh cover then we will flip them It depends on the personnel and it also depends on the player that you have On what makes CB Kendall Fuller a good fit at nickel corner He is smart I think from a smart player inside that has good quickness and capabilities of reading the route combinations And that guy sometimes if you move that corner into that nickel spot it is a lot of space its a lot of room and sometimes they dont have a great feel for it Kendall has been doing a great job We will be cross training of course Joshua Holsey has been doing it and we will be training some other corners inside as well On how Normans skill set fits into the defensive system It is the things that you cant coach I think from that standpoint he is just a savvy player that has a feel for the game I think even when you draft players coming out of college there is just certain guys that just have a feel for the game Its just uncanny Even Jonathan Allen has a feel for the game and you cant say anything but that these guys have a feel for the game That is what Josh has From defensive calls stick him in a one always covering that same guy over and over and over I am going to try to use his talents a little bit better try to get him in quarters a little bit and get him in different coverages that we have So we will get him to play the ball a little bit more On how important it is to see LB Junior Galette in game action before the regular season I think it is huge We have got to see him that way because he hasnt started he hasnt played in two years or whatever it has been During practice he has been doing a great job He is confident in his abilities His abilities are very good right now I think right now learning the defense he has done a great job but he has been banged up I want to see him against good personnel and see what he can do So it is majorly important that he plays in these preseason games On how his relationship with players has changed since transitioning from a position coach to a coordinator I dont think it has been any different They knew who I was and I talked to all the defensive players when I was here last year as an outside linebacker coach I think the biggest thing is the acquisition of the coaches that we have brought in With Jimmy and Torrian Gray and James Rowe and then with Chad Grimm and then Kirk Olivadotti all those guys its a tight group of coaches that are very specific I always tell the coaches this when I was a position coach I just facilitate the information from the guy that wants it to the players I cant sit in the room with 30 some guys and say OK this is what the corner is doing It is going to waste too much time They do a great job of facilitating the information that I am trying to get to those players and we are having success with it On how quickly S DJ Swearinger was able to integrate himself into the team I think it was the first week Just like the physical gifts and talents that players have some guys just have that aura about them and that is what he has He has that power I love the energy that he brings to the table and across the board he is trying to get it right I dont know exactly how many years he has been in the league but he has been doing a couple jumps back a forth from different teams He wants to see what he can do and see this defense where it is going to go and it is going to a high place I think On his perception of Normans play last year and if it has changed You know last year he played fine Sometimes it is just situational stuff Splits the receivers which Torrian Gray does a great job of talking about with the players across the board just honing their skills into the level of just breaking it down from a football knowledge I think that is what Torrian is doing with him and actually DJ helping him as well Everybody is helping each other on the back end From a calls perspective theyre doing a great job and we are playing together I dont care what call it is as long as we are all on the same page we will have success', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays preseason matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals Thursday Aug 24 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center OFFENSE DEFENSESPECIAL TEAMS', 'Back on the practice field this week following a hamstring injury that sidelined him during the second half of training camp Junior Galette could play in Sundays game against Cincinnati For more than two years now the Washington Redskins have waited to unleash pass rusher Junior Galette on the field A July 2015 free agent signing for the Redskins Galette registered 22 combined sacks across the 201314 seasons which ranked tied with Ryan Kerrigan for secondmost in the NFC and tied for sixthmost in the NFL in that span But since the end of the 2014 season Galette has yet to see the field in any preseason or regular season action Both his 2015 and 2016 campaigns were wiped clean by separate torn Achilles and he hasnt appeared in the first two preseason games this year as hes dealt with a hamstring injury Galette returned to the practice field on Wednesday though participating in individual drills alongside his fellow outside linebackers The team also tested him out on some of the 11ondrills which head coach Jay Gruden said Galette felt pretty good with after the completion of the session Its been two years so now its getting to the point where its like a movie thats supposed to be released and keeps getting postponed Galette said with a smile And youre like Man Then weve got Jay Gruden here talking about Youre just a tease You know hes kidding around but at the same time youre like I want to go out there and prove that I am everything they expect me to be The Stillman College product could potentially make his Redskins debut Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals although Gruden doesnt want to rush him back The head coach said hell be a gametime decision on Sunday afternoon I would like to get him some action before he plays because he hasnt played in a couple years Gruden said So I would like to get him out there but I also dont want to jeopardize his hamstring and have him reinjure it There is a fine line there We will have to wait and see how he does Getting Galette back on the field whether thats this Sunday against the Bengals or waiting until the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept 10 will provide the Redskins a boost to an outside linebackers corps that took a hit when Trent Murphy was lost for the year with a torn ACL and MCL suffered in the preseason opener against the Baltimore Ravens Gruden understands that Galette is fired up to return to game action Hes put a lot of work in Gruden said earlier this month Im proud of the fact of what hes accomplished getting his body right getting his weight down getting himself in football shape He feels like hes in as good of shape as hes ever been in Now its about working on his pad level his hand placement and all that stuff Hes on the right track Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky added that getting Galette preseason reps would be huge We have got to see him that way because he hasnt started he hasnt played in two years or whatever it has been Manusky said During practice he has been doing a great job He is confident in his abilities His abilities are very good right now I think right now learning the defense he has done a great job but he has been banged up I want to see him against good personnel and see what he can do So it is majorly important that he plays in these preseason games Before suffering a hamstring injury in training camp Galette was one of the standout players when the team was at the Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center in Richmond Va The speed rusher was giving fivetime Pro Bowler Trent Williams a run for his money at times during 1on1 drills which rarely happens Its the best way to get better Galette said of his camp battles with Williams Hes going into Year Eight and I played six years I cant think of an NFL lineman thats better than him so you have to take advantage Every chance I get to go up against him I tell him Im not going to take this play off because you dont get to see a lineman like that every Sunday His eventual return to the field 32 months after he last appeared in a game setting will be something special to watch Im going to give him a little credit too from this standpoint how many guys can have two Achilles on different ankles and work as hard as he has to get back to this point I think he did that said Redskins vice president of player personnel Doug Williams said I mean he cant control a little tweak of the hamstring I do believe if we can get him on the field well see some of the Junior Galette that we are looking for Im going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say I think we can get something out of him', 'The quarterback and wide receiver duo has been working together throughout the offseason but after two preseason games they still need to enhance their rapport The pursuit to get better has been the driving force behind the last year for Terrelle Pryor Sr switching positions to wide receiver and looking to take the next step in his career on a new team with a quarterback hes still adjusting to Thats been made clear throughout most of this offseason and training camp as both have made continual efforts to improve their games by learning from each others perspective and taking time for more reps after practice Wednesday offered another good example During drills Pryor caught a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins and while the connection looked clean something felt a little off for the wide receiver As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time The postpractice activity lasted for about 30 minutes and its the kind of work that Pryor believes should be endemic to the way professionals train If you know that something isnt right and then you dont fix it you really arent pros and you really dont take this job seriously That mindset is what has propelled Pryor this offseason evidenced in his countless workout videos he posted over the summer and its also what fuels Cousins who has needed to adjust to a new batch of receivers Particularly the workouts have been about timing accounting for different types of coverages and adjusting accordingly For example Pryor said he knows that when cornerbacks will throw press and bump coverage Cousins will take a hitch in his dropback knowing it will take Pryor a little longer to find separation from his defender This kind of work makes sense especially considering that Pryors only caught one pass on three targets in two preseason games Their preparation for those games was limited in terms of studying their opponents and Pryor was surprised by some of the coverages the Ravens threw at them in just a couple of series When we came out against the Ravensthey had safeties rolling over top doubleteaming me they had the safety double teaming me and nobody on top of the other guy Pryor said I didnt expect that in the preseason so little things like that happen that you werent expecting This is the rationale for not panicking about the firstteam offenses sluggish starts Pryor pointed to the Giants whose own offense has struggled even as it is expected to do big things this season too Pryor thinks there should be some bigger improvements against the Bengals this Sunday When you start gameplanning this is where were going were going to TP on this play were going to Jamison Crowder were going to Jordan Reed on this play this is the matchup were looking forward Pryor said We get in the game its there now its up to us to win it catch the ball and make the play Right now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday Cousins has appreciated Pryors approach and its rubbed off on his own work ethic I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year In other words theres nothing special happening here except in the desire to keep grinding and getting better than before to hit the ground running in sync and ready for the Eagles You just want to go back over it and make sure weve got it down Pryor said So when we get into the Week 1 and get into game time serious time its all clicking we can just go', 'Drafted in the sixth round of the 2017 NFL Draft Chase Roullier was brought in to provide depth for a talented offensive line Now hes getting a chance to work with the starting offense as a rookie Washington Redskins rookie center Chase Roullier celebrated his 24 th birthday in the spotlight on Wednesday Since being drafted in the sixth round of the 2017 NFL Draft Roullier has worked with the second and thirdteam offensive units outside of one training camp practice with the starters while Spencer Long was dealing with an illness But Roullier is taking a step up as Long is currently sidelined following minor knee surgery that will keep him out for the shortterm future It worked pretty well Roullier said of his work with the firstteam offensive unit Just continuing to learn the offense the best I can so that I am able to be more comfortable with my calls that Im making out there Its definitely something I need to continue to work on Ive had some errors in the last couple of games and its something Ive been focusing on practice Not only is Roullier making an adjustment to playing in the NFL and working with a Pro Bowl quarterback in Kirk Cousins hes trying to get a handle on being a fulltime center after splitting his college career between left guard where he started 24 games and center Theres obviously differences in the positions At center you direct you are the start of where everyone is going I have to figure out where everyone is going and their alignments Roullier said If I dont get that out quick enough it can screw up the entire play Thats something to continue to work on and be loud enough Roullier has an advantage though working with a veteran group on the offensive line To his immediate right is Pro Bowl guard Brandon Scherff who has started all 32 regular season games over the last two seasons And to his left is Shawn Lauvao an eightyear veteran who has appeared in 85 regular season games during his career In a lot of ways it helps because they already know what they are doing Roullier said So if Im making a wrong call there able to correct me at the line and make sure we are doing the right thing Its also though a little bit of more pressure because you are alongside great offensive lineman and you got to live up to their expectations The defensive unit tried to take advantage of Roulliers inexperience during Wednesdays practice bringing pressure and disguising their plans as he prepares to potentially start the Redskins final two preseason games From my perspective hes going to have to pick the offense up quick because the game is coming Sunday and a lot right now is riding on this because if he can do well for the ones hes going to be just fine said veteran defensive lineman Ziggy Hood Where he has a couple of hiccups every now and then he should and hes going to be OK and the thing is youve got Pro Bowlers all across the line so theyre going to help him knowing that the coach is not going to put him in harms way to where everything relies on him His job is to get the ball to the quarterback call out protections the best way he can and go from there Hood added that while the Cincinnati Bengals and Tampa Bay Buccaneers may not show their hands in the preseason he needs to prepare for the complexities of NFL defensive schemes once the regular season begins in September Come a regular week hes going to have time to study the tape theyre going to get the calls theyre going to make sure they have everything ready for him not only that what crafty vets are up front and what theyre going to do Hood said Hes going to be able to study each guy Hes just now getting into this role and he has a lot to do because Spence did a lotHe has a lot to do but hes going to be fine Its going to be a couple of adjustments hell have to work on but well find out when it comes Sunday Even with the amount of change hes had to go through over the last few months Cousins said Roullier had handled everything well to date Hes very intelligent You can tell hes a pros pro Cousins said He was a good draft pick He can pass protect I think thats a strength of his his ability to hold up in pass protection Theres going to be growing pains Thats understandable but its exciting to see potential when its there and its certainly there with Chase Hes a good teammate a class act so Im excited to work with him Were going to throw him in the fire against the Bengals and see what he can do Im going to do all I can do to help him making protection calls and trying to be decisive so he doesnt have to think too much But Im excited to get him out there and see what hes got', 'A list of stats and notes from the Washington

preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 The Redskins get the ground game back on track through some powerful running from Fat Rob In Washingtons first two preseason outings the combination of Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson struggled to generate a balanced offensive attack Against the Baltimore Ravens and Green Bay Packers the pair combined for just 21 rushing yards Those woes continued through the first quarter of Sundays nationally televised matchup with the Bengals as Kelley ran the ball just one time for four yards as the Redskins did not pick up a first down on the opening frame But in the second quarter Kelley finally got it going first with a fiveyard run and then a 21yard gain in which the Tulane product sliced the middle of an overly aggressive Cincinnati defense Kelley capped the drive with a oneyard touchdown run on 2 nd andgoal his first score of the preseason I think the difference for me was the offensive line Kelley admitted after the game They opened up some holes Obviously you can see they had some holes that anybody could run through out there I think just getting back to what got me to starting running back today Just some hard runs pushing the pile and stuff like that So we have to get back to the basics Kelley would finish the afternoon with 10 carries for 57 yards while Thompson chipped in with nine yards as well I think we were able to do a couple different things Gruden said We tried some gap pulls and some gap runs We did some outside zone some inside zones and for the most part I guess we executed well 2 For the first time as a member of the Redskins Junior Galette saw game action Galette joked in the days leading up to Sundays game with the Bengals that his return to the field was like a highly anticipated movie that kept getting delayed Originally signed by the Redskins during 2015 training camp Galette twice suffered torn Achilles that wiped away his last two years Then after an impressive early training camp showing this year Galette was held out of Washingtons first two preseason games with a hamstring injury But on Sunday Galette appeared on 21 defensive snaps and recorded two tackles It felt amazing man Galette said Coming in here going through the process getting on the bus from the hotel the pregame meal everything felt amazing like I never left Its been two years Just enjoying the camaraderie everything the pregame music on my headphones going out there warming up it felt great Galettes best trait as a football player is his speed rush On his very first play he nearly recorded a sack when the Stillman College product got a perfect jump off the line and ducked inside of the Bengals left tackle to apply pressure to Andy Dalton Dalton got the ball off on a quick threestep drop but Galette was just inches away from taking down the quarterback Ive been doing everything I did in the game in practice so it just felt great you know to just go do it in live action Galette said 3 Kirk Cousins was disappointed in his picksix but remains optimistic about whats ahead for the passing attack during the regular season In his final preseason action before the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Cousins completed 10of19 passes for 109 yards along with an eightyard carry on a third down quarterback keeper As was the case in his first two preseason showings Cousins struggled to get the offense moving in the first quarter In the first 15 minutes the Pro Bowler completed just 2of5 attempts for 11 yards while taking two third down sacks and being called for intentional grounding on another third down play Opening up the second quarter Washingtons offense appeared poised to final break through as the Redskins broke into Cincinnati territory in just four plays But on a 3 rd and5 attempt in which Cousins tried to locate Thompson coming out of the backfield Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict jumped the running backs route and sprinted down the sidelined for a 62yard interception return for touchdown The interception was entirely my fault Cousins said He made a very good play but I gave him the opportunity to do that by being a little late to get there And then it was a good response to put that drive together We ran the ball so well with some really good play calls All those plays run together for me right now so you probably know better than me how we got down there But it was important to bounce back certainly Washington responded well though to the interceptions as Cousins led a 10play 75yard touchdown drive in which he completed three different passes of at least 12 yards locating Vernon Davis Terrelle Pryor Sr and Jamison Crowder for the gains With tight end Jordan Reed back on the field Washingtons offense particularly the passing game is at nearstrength entering the regular season We do have high expectations for a lot of different reasons Cousins said of the passing game For one we do protect well we have a very solid offensive line thats where it starts You have to have time to throw We do feel we have several players not just at the receiver position but the tight end position and the running back position who can help us in the pass game and its never going to be the same guy week in and week out its probably going to evolve each weekwho gets involved and who makes the biggest difference But we have high expectations and you have to be ready to go 4 Jordan Reed returns from the PUP List to record two catches for 12 yards After spending the entirety of training camp rehabbing a toe injury Washingtons Pro Bowl tight end was activated off the Physically Unable to Perform list on Aug 20 He was a full participant in last weeks practices and showed little rust in his return to the field catching two passes for 12 yards both on first down attempts on 18 plays Its great Crowder said of Reeds return I think that now that everyone is back for the offense that we are able to go forward and practice get that camaraderie back within the unit and hopefully be ready and productive We have Philadelphia coming Reeds presence changed the way Cincinnati approached Washingtons offense as the tight end was doubled on more than one occasion I did feel the defense was aware of him Cousins said He is a presence has a big effect on every game plan so we have to continue getting him out there and working together and get ready for Week 1 5 With a chip on their shoulder the secondteam defensive unit slowed Cincinnatis backups After the starters played all of the first half inside linebacker Martrell Spaight and the second defensive unit took over in the third quarter In the second half Cincinnati managed just three points Their final five drives ended with two punts two turnover on downs and an interception I felt like we did a great job said Spaight who finished with a gamehigh seven tackles We got a few stops out there the turnovers the sudden change we did a good job and Im thankful for that Late in the game Cincinnati appeared ready to potentially take back the lead as they drove all the way down to Washingtons 12yard line with less than nine minutes remaining But a 3 rd and5 attempt by McCarron the quarterback misplaced a ball that would find the hands of rookie safety Fish Smithson who returned the ball 63 yards into Washington territory I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they was going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play', 'For the second straight week the Washington Redskins will tap Mason Foster as the teams starting Mike linebacker In the role he serves as the leader of the firstteam defensive unit Coming off a strong 2016 campaign Mason Foster appears ready to take on the role of Mike linebacker in Greg Manuskys 34 defensive scheme for the Washington Redskins After starting 13 games last season Foster has started both preseason games thus far and has been learning the ropes of being the signal caller of the defense Calling the defense will not be uncharted waters for Foster as he previously did so during his time with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers Nonetheless there is still a learning curve notes Manusky From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Manusky said But overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit Moving Foster into the Mike linebacker spot is no small request but for a player who prides himself on his versatility he seems ready to take on the challenge The University of Washington product credits Redskins coaches for his adaptability on the field I always prided myself on being a versatile player being able to play both spots he said But I mean its a lot on the coaches Before I came here I would always play Mike then I came here and learned Moe with Kirk Olivadotti Joe Barry and the rest of the coaches here Being able to play both inside linebacker roles undoubtedly makes things easier for the defensive coaching staff but Foster noted that it helps his individual play as well You just got to be a sponge learn it all Foster said Foster has been sharing the inside linebacker duties with newcomer Zach Brown who signed a oneyear deal with the Redskins this offseason after a Pro Bowl season in Buffalo last year Together Foster and Brown expect to lead a deep and talented linebacker crew that could be the best in the NFC East Brown brings special attributes to our group with his speed and his range He can definitely make up for a lot of mistakes and he has great instincts Foster said of his fellow linebacker Its exciting to have a group thats talented like this thats willing to help each other out and Im loving it right now Foster projects to be the preeminent runstopper of the group which is simply more of the same for him Listed at 6foot1 and 250 pounds the sturdy linebacker has made a living off of taking down opposing ball carriers over the past six seasons While he might be known more for his ability to slow down the running game Manusky has praised the performance in coverage this preseason of both Foster and Brown Foster seems to be having little issue juggling his new role with his execution on the field so far You know Mason played well last year He really did said head coach Jay Gruden We like his physicality Hes healthy and hes playing well', 'Last season linebacker Zach Vigil then playing with the Miami Dolphins was injured when his team travelled to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals It was unfortunate mostly because that meant he wouldnt get to face off against his younger brother Nick On Sunday now with the Redskins Zach will will have another chance to see and potentially play against his brother in person Im excited to see him Zach said I havent seen him since camp started Nick a starting linebacker for the Bengals this year played with Zach in college at Utah State where both earned firstteam AllMountain West Conference honors Zach joined the Dolphins as an undrafted free agent in 2015 and the following year Nick was a thirdround pick of the Bengals We talk two or three times a week to see how were doing talk about each others opponents and this week has been a little different Zach said We talk pretty regularly Nick and I are pretty close so we stay in touch Both grew up in Ogden Utah and have an extensive background as aspiring rodeo bull riders They eventually pivoted to football when Zach took a hard fall off a bull as a kid but both still enjoy roping in the outdoors When we go home we do a lot of stuff together Zach said We go hunting riding horses together train together Zach hasnt found anyone to go roping with in Northern Virginia yet but admitted it was easier in Florida to find places to go As for Nick its just the city there so he hasnt had a chance yet said Zach Zach still plays older brother and often during their phone conversations they will critique each others play and try to keep up with each others progress For Sundays game Zach has 12 tickets already reserved for family and friends including both of his parents Ive watched both of his preseason games on film right now and I think Nick looks really good hes been playing well Zach said Hes always around the football so yeah Im very supportive but I keep my eye on him', 'Check

Rob Kelley and a commitment to the rushing attack Like the first half of the Redskins preseason it took a while for the firstteam offense to find a rhythm against the Bengals Sunday evening at FedExField It didnt acquire a first down until the fourth series and didnt find the end zone until its fifth possession Unsurprisingly thats when the run game found its legs The kick starter for that crucial secondquarter scoring drive the tonic the team needed after quarterback Kirk Cousins s interception the play before put the team in an early 143 hole began with a 21yard run up the middle from Rob Kelley the first explosive jolt of the game From there the offense opened up running lanes got wider and playaction became more effective Kelley bookended the drive with a oneyard touchdown run up the middle highlighting the physical style the Redskins had been waiting to see from their leading running back It set the tone for the rest of Washingtons 2317 victory its first of the preseason Entering the game Kelleys preseason body of work was minimal He tallied just two yards on three attempts against the Ravens and nine yards on nine rushes at home versus the Packers His stats lines and the slow starts became a recurring topic of focus throughout the practice week something the offensive line took responsibility for and knew they wanted to fix We know what we can do right tackle Morgan Moses said We just got to get all 11 people on the field going and the right play calling And you know for Rob hes an amazing back All our running backs are amazing backs Its just about hitting the hole and getting the front block Kelley who finished with 57 yards on 10 attempts the team accounted for 96 rush yards gobbled up more yardage by consistently moving piles once running lanes clogged up turning short gains into something more manageable on the next down Unlike the previous two games five times on first down Kelley ran for at least five yards That was something Rob just focused on this whole week preparing he was like Man I got to on first down I got to get it to second and five and most of his runs he did that today running back Chris Thompson said It makes it easier for Coach Gruden it makes it easier for Kirk you know and it puts us in a really good situation all the time so as long as we run the ball well and we can control the clock the sky is the limit for our offense The extra efforts had a domino effect on the entire offense and as Cousins stated after the game the seas just parted After the 21yard gain Kelley ran for five yards opening up a playaction boot pass that Cousins completed to tight end Vernon Davis for another first down Rookie running back Samaje Perine added slight changeup around midfield pounding the rock to spell Kelley and continuing the pass games momentum with completions to Terrelle Pryor Sr and Jamison Crowder It takes a lot of pressure off of our passing game and off of me really good play design Cousins said I just thought Rob and Samaje ran really hard today They lowered their pads and did all the could trying to fight for extra yardsKelley finds a way when its a oneyard loss to get a twoyard gain I think thats the sign of a good back I think the difference for me was the offensive line Kelley said They opened up some holes Obviously you can see they had some holes that anybody could run through out there I think just getting back to what got me to starting running back today Just some hard runs pushing the pile and stuff like that Because the teams starters wont dress for Thursdays final preseason game this performance had some urgency to it With this being the final game action tuneup before the regular season head coach Jay Gruden remains confident that the offense will have more urgency and things will begin clicking quicker Kelley knows the run game is vital to that happening starting on Sept 10 when the Redskins host the Eagles to begin the regular season Hopefully come out there and pick up where we left off he said', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Monday August 28 2017 delivered by FedEx Ground All

opener in a couple of weeks But there was still a game to be played in the second half where some young defensive backs stepped in to make some big plays including a defensive stand in the red zone with the clock winding down that helped the Redskins defeat the Bengals 2317 to collect the teams first victory of the preseason A tally in the preseason win column may not seem like a huge deal in the broad scheme of things except that every player battling for a roster spot knows their performance will be under constant scrutiny Making plays is at once important for the team and as an individual achievement to take pride in Or as undrafted safety Fish Smithson reasoned Some people dont watch the preseason they say it dont matter but at the end of the day inside out it matters after the way we won and the players that were out there wanted to make a stand We didnt want to give in we make plays and let people know we belong on the field Smithson had one of the highlights of the day a fourthquarter interception off quarterback AJ McCarron in front of the end zone that he nearly returned for a touchdown tripping up after 63 yards After a mostly quiet first two games this was the moment Smithson knew he was capable of taking I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they were going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play I thought he was going to go all the way to house with it cornerback Joshua Holsey said But thats good for us these young guys especially for him because hes had a really good training camp preseason as well Holsey made his big plays too His moment came in the third quarter after he had already made a good play in coverage to force an incompletion on third down Sent on a nickel blitz he is the teams other nickel corner behind Kendall Fuller Holsey saw the left tackle occupy an outside linebacker and had a clear path once running Jarveon Williams stepped up to block another blitzer in inside linebacker Will Compton Holsey used his speed to run down McCarron and got the first sack of his NFL career Once I seen the tackle go high and the back disappear I just hit another gear Holsey said Had to make sure I secured the sack it was all fun from there Holsey who played 25 snaps Sunday knew hed get a decent amount of opportunities once Fuller sat out One of the nice surprises at camp the seventhround pick knows that the cornerback room is pretty full but Sundays game was another positive impression for coaches You get that gametime experience good close games youve got to be able to make plays Holsey said These games right here give the coaches a good key of who they can trust in big situations they gotta be able to trust you out there on that field When I go out there I just try to make sure I do my assignment and fly around to the ball Thats what they want to see they just gotta make plays Right not its just me trying to just show them what I can do because its a great DB room right now Just trying to help my role with that group of guys He remained on the field during the final red zone stand where veteran safety Will Blackmon made a couple of big plays in the backfield before defensive back Jeremiah McKinnon broke up a pass in the back of the end zone on fourth down You dont want to be the guy that gives up that play Holsey said We were all talking the whole drive like we gotta make a play we gotta make a play lets get this started lets get off the field so its just a big momentum rush for us to get out there and make a play get a stop for the team and get us that first W of the preseason Between Holsey and Smithson their biggest test will come this Thursday in the teams final preseason game at Tampa Bay After Sundays performances they will carry some confidence into the short week hoping to channel that momentum into another big night Its big Sometimes you can go through games and not be able to make plays because at the end of the day the only thing you got is the film Smithson said So its kind of good to show people what you can do At the end of the day I made a good play but now Im moving on to Tampa And as for those Fish puns saturating social media Smithson is happy to see them Oh man I can just imagine he said My phones been blowing up I havent looked at it yet but Im ready for it', 'An upcloseandpersonal look at the players from the teams 2017 preseason Week 3 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals presented by CareFirst', 'While he only appeared on 18 offensive plays against the Bengals Jordan Reed s presence changed the way Cincinnatis defense lined up against Kirk Cousins and Co Pro Bowl tight end Jordan Reed made his return to the field on Sunday after missing time with a toe injury catching two passes for 12 yards in his limited action Reed who went on the ActivePhysically Unable to Perform PUP list on July 26 practiced for the first time last Wednesday before making his preseason debut four days later He is a presence has a big effect on every game plan said quarterback Kirk Cousins of the tight end So we have to continue getting him out there and working together and get ready for Week 1 Cousins and Reed connected twice on four attempts against a Cincinnati defense that generated the fifthlowest opponent passer rating in 2016 Cousins pointed out that the Bengals made his tight end a focus in Sundays game doubleteaming him at times For Reed his impact is not just measured by the stat sheet but the attention that defenses are forced to pay him Hes being doubled if you will from a distance so we have to take advantage of the other side of the field when that happens said Cousins I did feel the defense was aware of him today Reeds four targets on Sunday were tied for the most on the team with wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr Now that he is back on the field Reed believes that the Redskins are close to being ready for the regular season I have got to go out and watch the film but from what I saw the Oline came out today and we ran the ball well said Reed after Sundays victory We just had a couple little minor errors Things we usually dont do drop the ball and things like that Once we get that cleaned up I feel like we are going to be coming for defenses Reeds return should instill senses of stability and familiarity into the offense as his fellow teammates are undoubtedly pleased to have him back on the field Wide receiver Jamison Crowder stressed the importance of getting that camaraderie back within the unit as the regular season approaches We have Philadelphia coming he warned Reed is not expected to play in the final preseason game on Thursday but will be ready to go when the Redskins host the Philadelphia Eagles in the regular season opener', 'The Redskins running back had a strong game in Tampa Bay last year to finish out the preseason This year hell have the same opportunity and hope to make the active roster this time For the second year in a row the Redskins will take on the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Raymond James Stadium to close out the preseason For the second year in a row running back Mack Brown will be doing everything he can to make a final impression for coaches just a couple days before the team cuts 37 players Brown had no trouble recalling last years affair which was moved up a day due to a Tropical Depression moving into the Tamp Fla area On a sloppy and slippery field Brown had a career game rushing for 149 yards and a touchdown with his family in attendance I was like I got to go I got to make some plays I got to ball out Brown remembered No excuses really no matter what the weather is His performance wasnt enough to make the teams active roster undrafted running back Rob Kelley who ran for 99 yards that game made it over him and he was placed onto the practice squad a sobering reminder of the leagues harsh realities Brown would eventually play in a Week 16 game against the Bears rushing eight times for 82 yards and a touchdown his only touches of 2016 Its crazy Brown said Everybodys journey is different Kelleys a baller We went into the game together both put up some numbers in that game so just thankful After a full calendar year Brown is in the same position but has more confidence in his roles and responsibilities He has a much stronger grasp of the offense trust from the coaches in his ability and better camaraderie with his teammates Last year even though you probably saw my stats a lot of people thought I should have made the team but I didnt know the protections theres no way I think I should have made the team last year Brown said This year Im paying faster in my protections I know where runs are going Im a better overall player in the offense now because coach Randy Jordan Coach Jay Gruden got me ready and Coach Cavanaugh got me ready for the season Maybe the stats in the preseason dont look like that because we didnt really run the ball that much but Im excited for this game Thursday get my feet wet a little bit Brown said Tuesday he was already locked into Thursdays game blocking any extra noise on social media that might influence his attitude His family is going to drive down from Atlanta Ga once again to see him play Any game can be your last game so to have your family support in the stadium is big for me he reasoned and is hoping to see another productive game I feel like any game I touch the ball is a big game Brown said Todays practice is a big practice for me Youre always getting looked at by everybody in the league so every day I use practice as a game so whether its preseason or regular season Im taking it as a Super Bowl game Nothing is ever guaranteed so you just got to leave the destination in Gods hands he added I always knew if I leave my

the linebacker said that he still has work to do before returning to his elite pass rushing form It was amazing Washington Redskins linebacker Junior Galette uttered this more than once on Sunday evening just minutes after playing in his first NFL game in nearly three total years For most a twoyear layoff following two major injuries would be enough to stop them from having success in the NFL Let alone those two injuries being torn Achilles robbing some burst on a player that thrives off his success at the line of scrimmage But for Galette he showed little rust on his first play during Sundays preseason matchup with the Cincinnati Bengals at FedExField in Landover Md On a 2 nd and3 play during Cincinnatis first possession Galette lined up on the right side of Washingtons defense opposite 2015 firstround pick Cedric Ogbuehi Off the snap Galette ducked under Oguehis right side and nearly sacked Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton on a threestep drop Weve been preparing pretty well you know weve got great coaches here whove been giving us keys It just felt great man Galette said Ive been doing everything I did in the game in practice so it just felt great to just go do it in live action In total Galette appeared on 21 defensive snaps after not playing in Washingtons first two preseason games due to a hamstring injury Galette admitted that hes still not quite 100 percent yet but he needed to get game action in during the preseason before the Redskins open up the regular season in two weeks against the Philadelphia Eagles Im able to go but Ive just got to keep getting the treatment that theyve been giving me Galette said I cant really bend that corner as fast as I want to or just playing with my leg Im still thinking about it mentally So yeah its almost there but I got enough time got a great coach he takes care of his guys and youve just got to make sure you bring that energy and passion on the field so he doesnt look crazy So thats all I got to do is get some rest on it and keep treating it like weve been doing and Ill be fine Even though the 29yearold looked like one of the quickest players on the field he was slightly frustrated because what he put on tape is not even me People will be like Man youre doing good but Im like This is not even me I just want to show you guys that I could be so productive but at the same time great organization Jay Gruden hes been giving me the time that Ive needed to get them rested It was my decision to play on Sunday and I went out there and he took care of me again The addition of a healthy Galette is a welcoming sight for the defensive unit as he was one of the NFLs top pass rushers in his final two seasons with the New Orleans Saints Galette tallied 22 combined sacks during the 201314 seasons which ranked tied with Ryan Kerrigan for secondmost in the NFC and tied for sixthmost in the NFL in that span I was happy to see him out there Kerrigan said I know hes been itching to get out there for a couple years now Not having been in the first couple games I know hes been itching to get out there so it was fun to see 58 flying around He had a couple of really nice rushes and the ball was coming out quick or else it probably wouldve been a sackfumble for him But it was good to see him out there good to see him making plays and doing what he does', 'Check out these photos of the Washington

coach Jay Gruden confirmed the news during his Tuesday afternoon press conference Taylor will have surgery on Wednesday I feel terrible for Phil because he did a great job at getting himself ready to

The former firstround pick of the Cleveland Browns hadnt played in a regular season game since 2014 but was named the teams starting nose tackle on the first unofficial depth chart of the year Prior to suffering multiple injuries during his final two seasons with the Browns Taylor was among the most productive linemen in the league during his rookie season as he recorded 59 tackles with four sacks two passes defensed and a fumble forced The Baylor product was named to the PFWA AllRookie Team for his efforts While Taylor struggled to replicate his debut season due to the injuries he looked sharp while the team was at the Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center in Richmond Va I was in Cincinnati for three years when he was at Cleveland and I know what a force he can be at nose said Gruden the former offensive coordinator of the Bengals earlier this month He was tough to deal with he really was We had him for a workout and I didnt even know he was on the streets His knee looked better He was in good shape He had a whole offseason and did some good things In total Taylor appeared on 23 defensive snaps during the preseason and recorded two tackles along with a sack With Taylor now sidelined the Redskins will look to Joey Mbu AJ Francis Stacy McGee and Ziggy Hood among others to fill the void at nose tackle Those guys have played well Gruden said Its been a constant battle throughout OTAs and training camp so those guys have gotten a lot of work Coach Jim Tomsulas rotated them in there different people with different groups part of the plan', 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On injuries The only injury that Ill go over is Phil Taylor Hes going to have surgery tomorrow He tore his left quad tendon He will be out for the year On the depth at nose tackle with DL AJ Francis and Joey Mbu Yeah Ziggy Hood can play there Stacy McGee can play there some too Those guys have played well Its been a constant battle throughout OTAs and training camp so those guys have gotten a lot of work Coach Jim Tomsulas rotated them in there different people with different groups part of the plan I feel terrible for Phil Taylor Sr because he did a great job at getting himself ready to play Hes in excellent shape but its just an unfortunate injury The rest of the guys have got to step up On his impressions of the firstteam offense from last Sunday Theres obviously a lot of coaching that we have to do clean up some things but overall I like the way we bounced back and stayed in the game Quite frankly thats the way a lot of our games are going to be in 2017 Theyre going to be close theres going to be some adversity and were going to have to overcome it and make some plays to keep us in games and then win them late There were some good things that we liked and obviously a lot of things that we need to clean up as is the case every week in pro football On what he hopes to see from the second and thirdstring players on Thursday Im hoping they play well Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust On if he would be more comfortable shifting DL Ziggy Hood and Stacy McGee to nose tackle as compared to more traditional nose tackles like Mbu and Francis Well see well see A lot is going to determine that how many defensive linemen are we going to dress on game day thats one if we dress five or six on game day how many were going to keep on the 53man roster Theres still some time for us to have those discussions and we will On if he feels more confident potentially starting Chase Roullier at center in Week 1 Yeah if I had to start him Id better feel OK because hes starting but he did some good things He mistargeted a couple plays which is natural a lot of movement Cincinnati had on certain down and distances But for the most part he did well He competed well and he stood his ground I felt him getting up to the next level a few times and he blocked some good defensive lineman over there so I was impressed with his first outing Weve just got to clean up some of his communication but overall I think he did well On if QB Nate Sudfeld will play the entire game Thursday Thats the intent yes On if Thursday is a chance for Sudfeld to prove he is worthy of a roster spot The thing about Nate is that Colt McCoy and Kirk Cousins are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back On his level of concern with WR Josh Doctson s injuries Well its been an issue Weve only had him a year a little bit over a year now and he hasnt really done a lot with us unfortunately but I think hes going to overcome these I think he could have played last week he could play Thursday if we wanted him to I think hes going to be ready to go for Philadelphia and now its a matter of keeping him out there and knock on wood we hope we can do that On if he views Doctson as a starting receiver Well we have some players there that have been performing in practice in his absence that have done well obviously Jamison Crowder and depends how many receivers you play If you play a tworeceiver set right now Crowder could be the starting Z it could be Josh it could be Ryan Grant We have plenty of options there The big thing is we want to keep them fresh If Terrelle Pryor Sr gets tired I wont hesitate at putting Josh at X or Ryan Grant at X or whatever so we have a good group of wideouts that could play anywhere at any time On if Doctson is having any trouble with confidence in his own health I dont know youd have to ask him that I think he just had some unfortunate he was running a lot in OTAs and training camp and he was doing some really good things It wasnt like he pulled it it was just tight I guess so to speak It hasnt been a major pull so I think hes going to be okay On if there is concern about LB Ryan Anderson being ready for the start of the season Well see I think if youve missed this much time theres some concern because he needs the practice Its not like we can just throw him out there Hey Hes a rookie he needs a lot of work the communication where hes supposed to be and how to get there So there is a little level of concern there but we feel like hell be ready eventually we just dont know when Its a unique injury Weve just got to get his strength back On if Roullier will play on Thursday Thats a good question You know we will wait and see come Thursday afternoon We will go through pregame warmup and see where we stand We will try to get Chase maybe a series or two and see how it goes but Ronald Patrick will get the majority We will go from there On if there is temptation to play players who might have starting roles who havent had a lot of reps Junior Galette is definitely not going to play He played with his injury very similar to Josh Doctson but he is not going to play Thursday Josh wants to play Thursday but that will be my decision here in about 24 hours On LB Will Compton RB Rob Kelley and CB Kendall Fuller Will Compton no he just has a chest contusion a little bit Kelley and Fuller Theyre OK they just took the day off a little sore On if he likes the new cutdown rules I do I do I do because I mentioned this before I just think that we have had these guys for so long that this is a great opportunity for a lot of them to play and show what they have not just for our team and our practice squad but for everybody else If you make a mad cut after the Thursday game or after our game against Cincinnati youre not going to be able to really pick anybody up You dont have the roster spots and then you dont have enough guys to play against Tampa because youre going to rest all your starters So it is great to have all these guys available and its great to see them play You give them an opportunity to see what they have in a pro stadium and a big game On his memories of last years game against Tampa Bay which was moved a day earlier because of Tropical Depression Nine That was a grind It was tough a tough week But we got through it and guys adjusted well They actually played well Mack Brown had a big game and did some good things We were able to look at a lot of good players On if he had previously played or coached in circumstances like that In a hurricane No That would be the first On if the team could look to add defensive linemen after roster cuts Yeah could be I think our scouts upstairs are looking at everybodys roster and projected cuts and seeing if there is somebody we could pick up that can help our football team well look at them Also for practice squad purposes But we feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Ive said that from day one I think with Joey Mbu and AJ Francis theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth But obviously if somebody they feel like is better well take a look On if he expects there to be a lot of fluctuation on the roster once all teams have cut from 90 to 53 Could be You know I dont anticipate a whole lot but you dont know Weve got to wait and see whos out there Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have On CB Joshua Holsey Ive been impressed with Josh Hes played nickel hes played corner Hes active Hes a good tackler Hes not the biggest guy in the world but he makes up for it with his smarts He knows where to go and where to be and has great coverage skills in my opinion I like his toughness I like his attitude and hes done well both inside and outside On which offensive coaches help in the booth Coach Matt Cavanaugh is up there He does good And then we have Kevin OConnell downstairs and obviously Wes Phillips downstairs and Coach Bill Callahan downstairs On if calling plays detracts from his time with the defense No I didnt spend a lot of time with them last year Every once in a while Id just pat them on the head and say good job or yell at them if they werent hustling I stay out of the schematics part of it Theyve already got all that stuff and the defensive coaches do an excellent job so well just let them do their job On areas in which RB Chris Thompson has improved this offseason Oh wow I think last year he was very good in his role I think we can expand his role if we want to Its just hes so good at the thirddown role that I just want to keep him there Hes a very valuable commodity to our football team both in pass protection and getting out on the routes I mean the thought of him not being around scares the heck out of me So hes improved every part of his game and a lot of these young players they do that You either get better or worse and hes just one of those guys that continues to work and hes gotten better at everything His vision on the running game and his pass protection has gotten better and better and his routes really are the most improved I think coming out of the backfield It takes some time for those guys to work their releases and work on the linebackers and run them at the right depth and come out at the right angles and all that stuff and hes darnnear perfected it', 'In the wake of devastating flooding from Hurricane Harvey which brought torrential rainfall throughout the Houston Texas region quarterback Colt McCoy a Texas native with friends and family in the region is doing all he can to help McCoy has lent his personal 16foot skiff boat to a group of friends one of them including former Texas football teammate Jordan Shipley to assist in relief efforts to help evacuate families around the west side of Houston He has also donated funds to a couple of organizations that will help purchase more boats to canvas flooded areas bringing supplies and transportation to those stranded by the storm Thats the least I can do from here McCoy said Tuesday after practice Its tough I dont have a family in Houston but everybody in America knows somebody from Houston theres six million people there It certainly has affected a lot of my friends and family Im just trying to do the things that I can from up here to help out McCoy said his brothers wifes family had to leave their home in the Houston region with their pets to stay in Austin where McCoy stays in the offseason and where much of his family lives now Everybody got out of there McCoys said of his sisterinlaws family Unfortunately they dont know whats going on or how bad its going to be yet Theyre back in Austin now and its just a waiting game trying figure out when they can get back The National Weather service announced Tuesday that Harvey had broken the alltime Texas rainfall record from a tropical storm or hurricane dropping more than 49 inches of rain in southeast Houston McCoy said one of his buddies informed him about the group they were forming to drive down from Austin to Houston to provide relief and McCoy told them to take his boat which had a trailer hitch for their truck They just hooked it up to the truck and drove as close as they could to the west side of Houston and have gone into neighborhoods and theyre just helping out McCoy said I wish I could be there to help that They specifically went to a couple neighborhoods I dont know exactly where they are that people were basically stranded out in the second floor of their house he said Nobody really knew how bad it was going to be you might only have two or three days of supplies Living upstairs in your house for that long youre going to need a way out What it sounds like to me is the more that they can give the better so were giving funds to buy a few more boats It doesnt have to be anything fancy just something they can move around in Three other Redskins Trent Williams Dustin Hopkins and Joey Mbu all spend time in Houston during the offseason and have been monitoring the situation closely making sure friends and family members that live in the area are OK Obviously our prayers are with all the people in Texas especially Houston said McCoy who grew up west of Dallas in Tuscola Lots of high school football teams have had to cancel part of their schedule and its affected so many lives that we just really dont think about', 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda breaks down the

Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win TIME FOR THE SUDFELD SHOW The plan for Thursdays preseason finale against the Buccaneers as was the case last year is to have Nate Sudfeld start and play the entire game at quarterback Since being selected in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft last year Sudfeld has been Washingtons No 3 quarterback behind Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy His reps are few and far between as the third string quarterback so Thursday will show just how much hes progressed in the past year The thing about Nate is that Colt and Kirk are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back So far this preseason Sudfeld has completed 11of23 passes for 132 yards along with five rushing yards Last year the Indiana product capped off his first preseason completing eight passes for 72 yards and a touchdown in a driving rainstorm at Raymond James Stadium ENCORE PERFORMANCE FOR MACK In that rainy weather last year Washington was able to show the depth of the running back position with Mack Brown 149 and Rob Kelley 99 rushing for a combined 248 yards It was the conclusion of a training camp battle that would see Kelley edge out Brown for a spot on the Redskins first 53man roster But Brown would reemerge after spending the first half of the year on the practice squad In a Week 16 victory over the Chicago Bears Brown rushed for a gamehigh 82 yards 61 of which came on a fourth quarter touchdown run With Kelley Chris Thompson and rookie Samaje Perine expected locks on the active roster this year Browns performance against the Buccaneers on Thursday could go a long way into Washingtons brass needing to keep four running backs up During the offseason Brown cut down on his body fat while honing in on improved agility and speed through the help of players like LeSean McCoy and Tevin Coleman His hope is that itll result in a stronger 2017 campaign You watch Thompson every day and see that he is quick but then you see McCoy and I have never seen feet like that in person before Brown said He would just tell me think about Kobe Bryant Kobe worked on his shot every day his dribble every day post moves so why not work on your cuts every day He was right I lift and run but I dont do footwork every day He said he works on his balance and footwork every day so he can come out his cuts better So ever since then I have been working on coming out my cuts and balance drills THE SEARCH FOR THE RIGHT COMBINATION COMES TO A CLOSE While training camp and the preseason can tell a story for how reps will be delved out during the regular season for most position groups that isnt the case for the defensive linemen Under new defensive line coach Jim Tomsula the Redskins have tried just about every combination possible with the linemen on the 90man roster Washington of course lost Phil Taylor Sr for the season with a torn quad tendon The veteran was atop the depth chart at the nose tackle position So how players like Joey Mbu and AJ Francis perform against the Buccaneers could help in final decisions for which defensive linemen to keep on the 53man roster We feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Gruden said Ive said that from day one I think with Joey and AJ theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth ONE LAST IMPRESSION Less than 48 hours after the opening kickoff goes into the air at Raymond James Stadium Washington will have to slice down the roster from 90 players to 53 There will certainly be difficult decisions for the front office as is the case every year and there will be nerves for the players on the bubble But Grudens hope is that everyone who dresses the starters likely wont have their best performance yet Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Gruden said Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust For the pro scouts theyll have a busy weekend ahead but Gruden is confident the staff is prepared to assemble the best 53man roster Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them Gruden said But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Wednesday August

with the 2016 Sam Huff Defensive Player of the Year Award Wednesday at the Redskins Welcome Home Luncheon Kerrigan who led the Redskins in sacks for a third consecutive season with 11 takedowns of the quarterback remains the cornerstone of the Washington defense He also forced two fumbles and had two pass deflections to go along with 33 tackles The Purdue product dealt with a handful of injuries in 2016 but started every game for a sixth consecutive season Hes now played in all 98 Redskins games including two playoff contests since being drafted by the Redskins in the first round of the 2011 NFL Draft Yeah you know not a lot people talk about Ryan anymore Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said of Kerrigan during training camp this year Hes just always there hes a mainstay for us and hes a very productive player Hes an excellent player against the run which goes unnoticed sometimes by a lot of people But he sets the edge extremely well Its hard to run to his side and then his pass rush is still pretty darn effective So I think hes still going to be a doubledigit sack guy for us Since entering the league in 2011 Kerrigan has the fifthmost sacks in the NFL trailing only JJ Watt Von Miller Cameron Wake and Justin Houston Fittingly a sack master in his own right former Redskins defensive end Dexter Manley was at the luncheon to hand Kerrigan the award Manley had four consecutive doubledigit sack seasons for the Redskins from 19831986 including his careerhigh 185 sacks in 1986 that earned him FirstTeam AllPro honors Kerrigan trails only Manley and Charles Mann on the Redskins

score against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 5 It was Washingtons first punt return for touchdown since the 2008 season snapping the longest drought in that category in the NFL When I caught it I ran to the left and saw there was a crease Crowder said It might have be Deshazor Everett a couple guys were on their blocks really well I saw a crease I was like Im going to hit it Im going to go with it I was able to break a tackle or two run and score After a diving block by tight end Niles Paul helped get two Ravens off track so much so that they would collide Crowder juked Baltimore punter Sam Koch the final roadblock before the end zone In the process Crowder became the youngest player for the franchise to score a punt return touchdown since 1991 From my perspective its just the guys blocking a lot better Crowder said last October Last year we had a mixture of pains Sometimes Id make the wrong cut other times guys were in my face This year our guys have been doing a really good job of holding up Im able to catch the ball and have a lot of yardage even before the first defender is down there So theyve done a really good job of blocking Two weeks prior to his touchdown against the

to his left freeing himself of a tackle attempt by Dwayne Harris before going crossfield for the long return At the time it was the longest punt return by a Redskins player since the 2012 season I knew that my chances were slim of getting a return Crowder said But the punter kind of kicked a rugby type punt and the ball bounced and rolled I was just like Im going to take a chance and I made the first guy miss I just tried to get to the sideline but I was so tired though I just tried to make a play give us a spark and put us in position to at least come away with some points In total Crowder

drive came when Sudfeld completed a pass to wide receiver Matt Hazel for a 23yard gain in which the Coastal Carolina product dragged his foot to secure the ball Despite failing to convert on fourth

and Torrey Smith Despite coming off a career low in receiving yards 267 in his second season with the San Francisco 49ers Smith is still just 28 years old In 2014 he recorded 11 receiving touchdowns

opportunity to catch coaches eyes rookie linebacker Josh HarveyClemons finished out the preseason with an interception return for a touchdown in the Redskins victory over Tampa As time ran out for players to make a few more impressions during the Redskins final preseason game linebacker Josh HarveyClemons took advantage of his last opportunities This years seventhround draft pick had had a mostly quiet preseason transitioning from safety to dime linebacker and adjusting to his new responsibilities within the thirdteam defense but near the end of the fourth quarter of the teams 1310 victory the diligence in learning paid off HarveyClemons adjusted well to a playaction deep in Buccaneers territory and after a couple steps forward sprinted backwards into coverage He turned to the right as a streaking wide receiver Bobo Wilson came into his picture where the pass from Tampa Bay quarterback Sifo Liufau spun into his lap The Louisville product using an impressive block from linebacker Nico Marley and then near the goal line from Stefan McClure fought his way through traffic for 41 yards to find the end zone giving the Redskins a lead they wouldnt relinquish It felt great man HarveyClemons said It was a playaction pass and its something we work on with the linebackers all the time once you feel the flow of the running back and its a playaction turn and find the crossing receiver and I got up under him and the quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play HarveyClemons was mobbed by teammates on the sideline afterward celebrating the rookies biggest play of the preseason I mean it felt great man he said Those guys are great competitors theyre great leaders and they were with me the whole game telling me especially Zach Brown and Mason Foster telling me different reads and keys and stuff like that to be looking for as a linebacker and those guys have done a great job all camp with leading and Im just following their lead and trying to make plays Entering the game head coach Jay Gruden expressed his hope that the younger players limited in action during the third preseason game would take advantage of their increased playing time Thursday night using the techniques they had learned and react accordingly Overall HarveyClemons who at times looked extremely explosive accrued five tackles and led a defense that had the Buccaneers number for most of the night The Redskins outgained Tampa Bay in yards 194 to 40 in the first half holding them scoreless and kept quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to just two completions on seven attempts I feel like we played great as a whole defense we shut them out the first half and then we gave up a touchdown late in the second half but we held them on the last drive from winning it or taking it to overtime So I feel like overall we played together we made the plays we needed to make down the stretch to win the ballgame Despite regretting a few missed sacks in the earlygoing a product of his burst through the middle of the line in which he couldnt recover as Liufau moved up into the pocket HarveyClemons was pleased with his effort In four games he acquired 15 tackles and now has an interception and touchdown for good measure Like his fellow rookies and players on the fringe of the roster he will spend the next couple of days awaiting a decision from coaches relying on his play over the past offseason and preseason to determine his shortterm future Its tough man he said but you just got to pray and hope for the best and

took place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla 1 Nate Sudfeld puts together a solid final preseason showing With Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy taking the majority of practice and preseason reps over the last few months Sudfeld finally got his chance to see extended action on the field for the Redskins and he did not disappoint Exactly one year after his last start Sudfeld completed 22of33 passes for 278 yards along with two carries for four yards in a 1310 victory over the Buccaneers I thought it was a pretty solid night pretty efficient for the most part in terms of moving the ball Sudfeld said But disappointed that we werent able to get more points for whatever reason we were kind of getting bogged down at the end of drives but we were moving the ball which is good But again we need to finish So it was a solid night overall but a lot to improve on Not only was Sudfeld able to get the Redskins moving the secondyear Indiana product completed passes to 11 different players four of which recorded at least 30 receiving yards It was important for Sudfeld to have a good final outing with the roster being sized down to 53 players on Saturday afternoon With Sudfeld serving as the No 3 quarterback last year he was inactive for all 16 games So he understands that he doesnt have a ton of job security Theyre never easy Sudfeld said of roster cut deadlines You know whether you make the squad or not like last year I made the squad and so many of my good buddies didnt so its tough regardless So Im going to be there probably hanging out with some of my buddies my brother will be in town so well hang out and maybe go golfing or something probably try to get my mind off it but Ill see what happens 2 Mack Brown confident he made an impression With the Redskins top three running backs consider locks for the 53man roster Brown was one of many players on Thursday night putting the finishing touches on what they hope is enough positive tape to get active status In total Brown carried the ball 18 times for a gamehigh 69 yards One game doesnt determine my fate Brown said Ive been going hard ever since Day 1 at camp Whatever happens happens Ill leave my hand in Gods hands Im encouraged Im not discouraged Im thankful Brown was a numbers game cut last year for the first 53man roster but the University of Florida product eventually got his number called again in Week 8 last year While he was just a special teams contributor for most of the season he did record a 61yard touchdown against the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 victory Even if it isnt in Washington Brown believes hell be on an NFL roster once again this season I will be playing football somewhere this year Brown said I know that for a fact because God told me last night So whatever happens happens Like I said before I will always be a Redskin no matter what gives Not having a college career being fourthstring in my senior year they gave me a chance that nobody else did so Im thankful and Ill always love the Redskins I feel like the Redskins will win the Super Bowl this year 3 In a crowded wide receivers room Matt Hazel saved his biggest game for last Just as is the case at so many other positions for the Redskins this year the wide receivers group is loaded with talent Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder are all expected to get their targets and Ryan Grant remains someone the coaching staff is high on Beyond those four though the Redskins have eight other players on the 90man roster trying to make the active squad Among them is Matt Hazel a player who spent the majority of last season on the practice squad During Thursday nights game Hazel was the most productive wide receiver for both teams catching all four of his targets for a gamehigh 60 yards I felt like I was so locked in Hazel said I didnt really keep count Nate did a great job weve been talking the whole week we were trying to connect Then I didnt really get too many opportunities with him in the first couple games and not really too much on practice But we hooked up and I think that was just good communication throughout the week understanding what we see we did a good job watching film breaking these guys down and made some plays Hazels best catch of the night came on a 23yard reception in which he dragged both feet to secure the ball inbounds That was an incredible catch Sudfeld said I just tried to get my back shoulder throw it where they aint as we say throw it where theyre not So he made a great catch on it and I would like to see some of those on film I havent really seen them 4 Josh HarveyClemons comes through with the top defensive play of the night In a game were neither offense could get into the end zone through the first three quarters HarveyClemons finally logged the nights first touchdown on a 41yard picksix Tampa Bay quarterback Sifo Liufau tried to roll out on a play action pass and complete a pass to one of his wide receivers but the rookie linebacker took advantage of a an overthrown pass coupled with solid downfield blocking by the defense to score Its something we work on with the linebackers all the time HarveyClemons said Once you feel the flow of the running back and its a play action turn and find the crossing receiver and I got up under him and the quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play HarveyClemons felt putting the turnover on tape was important as he missed on other plays earlier in the game I missed a couple of sacks at the beginning and I was kind of down about that but its part of the game HarveyClemons said You just have to keep playing the next play and our defense played great and we held up tonight and thats all you can ask for 5 The Redskins have less than 48 hours before the initial 53man roster is set With the conclusion of Thursday nights game the Redskins are one step closer to the regular season But before they practice once again nearly half of the team will either be released or waived It is a tough reality in the NFL but one players arent unfamiliar with Still it makes the next few days very difficult Ive built a lot of relationships Brown said Like I said before Im thankful and were always going to be friends The guys that became friends were going to be friends after this Im just thankful to be on the field with you guys for the last time For Hazel meanwhile he said the wide receivers have never viewed it as a competition We just support each other when they make plays Hazel said Brian Quick James Quick made plays today Jamari Staples even got out there and made a couple plays So you just cheer your teammates on and really try to show some leadership Really thats it I dont ever really look at it like competition nothing like that Head coach Jay Gruden said the team will be ready to assemble the best 53man roster possible We have a full staff thats on board with that theyve been watching Gruden said of Saturdays cutdown process From training camp on they have been studying other teams We are not just going to wait for the waiver wire and look at it and say Oh my gosh these guys prepared They are anticipating

store for him as hes confident hell be on an NFL roster He hopes that roster is in Washington A storm of uncertainty swirls around every preseason finale With the starters watching from the sidelines its up to the backups to make the most of what could be their final opportunity to impress before the final roster cuts Redskins running back Mack Brown made the most of this opportunity kickstarting Washingtons running game in a 1310 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday evening at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla The secondyear back out of Florida took most of the handoffs in the contest gaining 69 yards on 18 carries While his production was not filled with highlightlevel runs he did provide something the Redskins running game had been lacking for most of the preseason consistency What would have been an otherwise spotless night for Brown was marred slightly by a fumble in the third quarter near midfield that the Buccaneers recovered Brown said his teammates helped him rebound after the mistake and that he was grateful for the bond they have share during the offseason Youve got to tell the next guy Lets get it Youve got to help each other up Youve got to keep that groove going he said Thats the main thing You play as one team everything works Brown indeed recovered from the mishap bursting through the line during the next drive on a power run to the left He gained 11 yards in no time marking his longest run of the night on a drive that would eventually put Washington up 60 Most of the preseason running game was dominated by Rob Kelley and rookie Samaje Perine However it wasnt until Thursday that the lanes finally seemed to open up for the backs to gain some yards Although no offensive touchdowns were scored Brown quarterback Nate Sudfeld and an armada of receivers outgained Tampa Bays offense by 118 yards When the fervor of victory died off after the game Brown turned his attention towards Saturday when final cuts will be made to form a 53man roster Brown who has been on the verge of not making the team before said he was not overly concerned on the teams decision come Saturday One game doesnt determine my fate Ive been going hard ever since day one at camp Whatever happens happens Ill leave my hand in Gods hands Im encouraged Im not discouraged Im thankful he said Head coach Jay Gruden said after the game that he was overall impressed with the young running back and his determination through the final preseason game However he agreed with Brown that one game will not be the only factor in the upcoming decisions Its a process Its not just a night its the body of work that hes put in Gruden said Hes done some really good things he really has not only at running back but on special teams Well take everything into account but when its all said and done it comes down to numbers With the thoughts of uncertainty successfully driven out of his mind Brown focused on the most memorable of his experiences with the Redskins and took a moment to praise the myriad of teammates that have surrounded him for the past two years Ive built a lot of relationships Brown said Im thankful and were always going to be friends The guys that became friends were going to be friends after this Im just thankful to be on the field with you guys for the last time Brown gave one last piece of advice for those players who might

2017 regular season OFFENSE Quarterback 2 Kirk Cousins Colt McCoy Final Cuts 1 Nate Sudfeld Analysis As has been the case over the last twoplus years now Cousins is Washingtons starting quarterback with McCoy who has started 25 games in his NFL career serving as a veteran backup But for the first time in a few years now Washington has elected to go with just two quarterbacks on the initial 53man roster as they have waived Sudfeld a 2016 sixthround pick Sudfeld was on the active roster for the entirety of his rookie season but did not dress in any of the Redskins 16 regular season games The Indiana product did start Washingtons preseason finale on Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers completing 22of33 passes for 228 yards Even though he was among the players waived by Washington on Saturday the team remains high on his development and could bring him back on the practice squad Running Backs 4 Rob Kelley Samaje Perine Chris Thompson Mack Brown Final Cuts 2 Matt Jones Kenny Hilliard Analysis Just as they did during the final months of the regular season last year the Redskins will carry four running backs on the active roster Kelley of course returns as the teams starting running back and head coach Jay Gruden is steadfast in his praise of Thompson in the thirddown back role Washington also brought in Perine during the 2017 NFL Draft as the 5foot11 236pound bruiser provides Washington with a short yardage back that could solve some of the red zone struggles from 2016 While it was assumed all three would be on the active roster to start the year Brown was able to push his way back into the fold Brown may not have his number called early on the offensive side of the ball as the likely No 4 running back but he plays a vital role on special teams I liked what he brought to the team on special teams Gruden said last month Then he had a big breakout run against Chicago which was excellent Hes progressing Jones meanwhile was waived following two seasons in Washington after the Redskins selected him in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft The University of Florida product started the first seven games last year as the replacement for Alfred Morris but injuries and ball security issues coupled with the rise in production from Kelley resulted in the 24year old being inactive for the final nine games of the season Wide Receivers 5 Jamison Crowder Josh Doctson Terrelle Pryor Sr Ryan Grant Brian Quick Final Cuts 7 Robert Davis Maurice Harris Matt Hazel Levern Jacobs Zach Pascal James Quick Jamari Staples Analysis At one of the deepest position groups for the Redskins Washington is electing to start the season with five wide receivers as returners Crowder Grant and Doctson are joined this season by Pryor and Quick Washingtons top four receivers of Crowder Doctson Pryor and Grant seemingly were locked in but there was a tight battle for that last spot Quick edged out Davis and Harris though among others The veteran is coming off a career best season with the Los Angeles Rams as he recorded 41 receptions for 564 yards and three touchdowns As for the three starters on Washingtons unofficial depth chart Doctson Crowder and Pryor the hope is that the trio can produce in similar fashion to the way Crowder Pierre Garon and DeSean Jackson did last year Despite the Redskins waiving seven receivers Washington has ample options for the practice squad Davis was a sixthround pick in this years draft and had a strong showing during training camp Robert has done some good things not just catching the ball but blocking Ive been impressed with him Gruden said Were trying to run the ball Any time you want to be a physical running football team you have to have physical receivers to go in there and block safeties from time to time sometimes even linebackers Robert has proven he can do that Hes not afraid thats for sure Harris meanwhile went from practice squad to active roster last season recording eight receptions for 66 yards in 10 games while Hazel spent the final two months of 2016 on Washingtons practice squad Tight Ends 4 Jordan Reed Vernon Davis Niles Paul Jeremy Sprinkle Final Cuts 2 Manasseh Garner EJ Bibbs Analysis Just prior to Saturdays cutdown deadline the Redskins announced that they acquired a seventhround selection from the Rams in exchange for Derek Carrier Carrier spent two seasons with the Redskins and looked solid in his lone full offseason on the field in Washington but with so much depth at the position the team received compensation for the Beloit College product instead of outright releasing him As for the four tight ends that are on the active roster position coach Wes Phillips believes it is the deepest tight ends group in the NFL today and itd be hard to argue against that Reed of course is among the best at the position today while Davis has experienced a renaissance of sorts in Washington Last year the veteran recorded 44 receptions for 583 yards and two touchdowns Paul meanwhile can play multiple positions on offense including fullback while remaining one of the Redskins best special teams players Rounding out the group is Sprinkle a fifthround selection out of Arkansas While the 6foot5 252 pounder can be a pass catching threat Gruden believes Sprinkle is going to be a Y tight end in this league for a very long time Hes going to get stronger and stronger every year and hes got very good hands Gruden said Hes got deceptive speed but you really like him as an inline blocker Offensive Linemen 8 Shawn Lauvao Spencer Long Morgan Moses Ty Nsekhe Brandon Scherff Trent Williams Chase Roullier Tyler Catalina Final Cuts 8 Lucas Crowley Kyle Kalis John Kling Arie Kouandjio Kendall Pace Vinston Painter Ronald Patrick Isaiah Williams Analysis The Redskins return their starting offensive line from a year ago with Williams a fivetime Pro Bowler leading the way but theres two new faces in the room Roullier and Catalina have cracked the active roster as rookies although the two joined the Redskins on different paths Roullier is a sixthround pick out of Wyoming that has been thrusted into the spotlight recently with Long sidelined by a knee injury The 24yearold started Washingtons preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals and appeared on 40 snaps with the firstteam offensive unit He didnt look out of place against an aggressive Bengals frontseven just as he hadnt at all during training camp Hes done a great job he really has Gruden said For a rookie to come in here and handle all the things he has to handle its been very impressive Chase has got a ways to go obviously but hes on the right track Hes a true center He might have to play a little bit of guard from time to time If hes going to dress on game day hes going to have to back up guard and center So well get him going but the starting point is to really find a good center As for Catalina he joined Washingtons roster as a college free agent signing in May He has the versatility to play multiple spots along the line as was the case against the Buccaneers when he played at right tackle left tackle and right guard DEFENSE Defensive Linemen 6 Jonathan Allen Ziggy Hood Anthony Lanier II Stacy McGee Terrell McClain Matt Ioannidis Final Cuts 4 Brandon Banks Joey Mbu Ondre Pipkins AJ Francis Analysis One of the most difficult positions to gauge in terms of roster decisions throughout the preseason the defensive lines standing became a little bit clearer on Saturday with the decision to keep six defensive linemen on the active roster Hood returns as the elder statesman of the group as the 30yearold can play both end positions and nose tackle The Redskins also return secondyear linemen in the form of Lanier and Ioannidis both of whom the coaching staff is looking for an uptick in production this year Hes gotten a lot stronger in the weight room Gruden said of Ioannidis a fifthround pick for Washington last year Its kind of what I was hoping Getting him

guy that can rush as a threetechnique this day and age especially third down thats a huge benefit for us He also is excellent against the run I think he proved that at Alabama his last year He was

game in the final minutes It was another example of the Redskins resiliency coming up big on the road in a game that felt necessary to win These road games provide unique traveling experiences ones that occur at least eight times each season which are nothing new but are rarely documented When does a team get to its predetermined location How do players approach each part of their journeys What

game and things about what I need to do to be influential in the game while Im on the flight Crowder says 2 300 pm Friday Board plane at Dulles International Airport As the season progresses and it gets a little colder Crowder will opt for a blazer But on a relatively warm day and nearly five hours of sitting inside a plane awaiting him Crowders priority is feeling comfortable Thats why he goes with just a shirt as he walks up the plane steps I wanted to look as presentable as possible without wearing a suit because I knew the flight was going to be long he says I wanted to feel comfortable So I made sure that was one of the things that I kept in mind was that to wear a nice shirt nice jeans nice pair of dress shoes and still be comfortable I made sure that I tried to look as clean as possible 3 315 pm Friday On the plane Crowder is assigned a window seat which suits him just fine He starts off the trip with some music Obviously Im a big J Cole fan so I listened to some of his albums some of his mixtapes and then decides to watch the movie Hidden Figures About midway through I ended up falling asleep so Im going to have to go back and watch the end because I dont know what happened But it seemed like a pretty good movie up to the point that I didnt watch Crowder says Im definitely going to have to finish that Once I woke up I probably had another hourandahalf or so until we landed I just put back on my music for the time being and that was pretty much it Once we got to the West Coast once we got closer over there I turned on some Kendrick Lamar I was trying to

the room pretty much for the rest of the evening 5 100 pm Saturday Bus to UCLA for practice The work doesnt end on Saturday The team has its usual walkthrough practice scheduled but because theyre in a new city they must borrow a practice field This time UCLA comes to the rescue offering up their facility for the team to get in sync one last time before Sundays game They had a really nice facility from the little bit that we saw Crowder says I think that whole bus ride there from the hotel to the facility was pretty cool because you get a chance to kind of see the difference get views of the different landscapes of LA Me being from the south and being used to more land and more open areas seeing LA and all the houses and stuff right close together and all the palm trees and all that kind of stuff it was a cool bus ride from the hotel to the practice field Once I got there UCLA has a really nice facility and it was pretty cool 6 230 pm Saturday Return to hotel After the team returns from walkthrough practice players have their options to find dinner and prepare for the game ahead Crowder meets up with a friend who worked in Los Angeles and the two walk down the street to grab some dinner and talk for some more in the hotel lobby Then its time to relax For the most part on Saturday I just try to chill out and stay off my feet as much as possible and really just do the things I need to do to get my body ready for the game he says Whatever hotel were in I make sure I have my bag of epsom salts and always run me a warm bath just to kind of loosen up my muscles and

thinking about the movie Money Talks a movie with Chris Tucker Crowder says At the end of the movie Chris Tucker took this French guys diamonds and had them hidden at the Coliseum Theres a part in the movie towards the end I kind of laughed to myself Chris Tucker grabs the diamonds and yells to the French guy Is this what you want So he takes the diamonds and just tosses them and throws them down the Coliseum steps You have to see the movie So I was thinking about that But it was cool playing there for the first time and I was just glad we could get the win 9 625 pm Sunday Board plane at LAX After changing back into their casual clothes players walk up the Coliseum tunnel board the buses and depart for the airport Awaiting them is another fourhourplus flight home but this one will be much sweeter Its definitely better when you win Its not as bad he says I knew it was a long flight Like I said I made sure that I had my headphones my phone charged up put back on my music I ended up taking a nap and fell asleep for much of the flight It was uncomfortable but I stayed asleep I didnt even watch a movie this time I played a little bit of solitaire By the time I woke up we were

Jay Gruden last month You know youve got first and second down Youve got base youve got nickel youve got dime and youve got all these sub packages now that people have to run in and out You know we might only have one defensive lineman on the field at one time Sometimes well have two sometimes well have four and sometimes well have five So you know its a very specialized group now and it calls for a lot of substitution On the first unofficial depth chart of the regular season for the Redskins rookie Jonathan Allen and free agent addition Stacy McGee are listed as the starting defensive ends while veteran Ziggy Hood is the starting nose tackle Allen of course was the Redskins firstround pick in the 2017 NFL Draft A dominant player against college completion Allen impressed during training

28 kickoffs for 583 yards and seven punts for 36 yards Where Thompson has made a name for himself recently is as a third down back for the Redskins But his role could expand this season First second down there is some feature plays we like for him in the backfield said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden But I think when youre talking about Chris youre talking about taking care of your body in the offseason getting a little bit stronger just continuing to work on your craft Ive never had an issue with Chris Hes one of the smartest players on our team Youre always looking to get better and I think his way of getting better is to take care of his body in the weight room obviously running and keeping himself in shape which he has Last year Thompson recorded a careerhigh 49 receptions for 349 yards and two touchdowns While hes proven to be an option catching out of the backfield for quarterback Kirk Cousins he also excels in pass blocking situations Hes a very valuable commodity to our football team both in pass protection and getting out on the routes Gruden said I mean the thought of him not being around scares the heck out of me So hes improved every part of his game and a lot of these young players they do that You either get better or worse and hes just one of those guys that continues to work and hes gotten better at everything His vision on the running game and his pass protection has gotten better and better and his routes really are the most improved I think coming out of the backfield It takes some time for those guys to work their releases and work on the linebackers and run them at the right depth and come out at the right angles and all that stuff and hes darnnear perfected it Thompson thanked the Redskins on Twitter', 'Former Georgia offensive

You know some people football is not for them but I know he has a strong passion for the game and wants to play but there are some other things in his life that he needs to keep private that we will keep private that he has to take care of Cravens had recently been sidelined with a knee injury suffered in Washingtons preseason opener against the Baltimore Ravens last month But over the weekend Cravens approached Gruden in his office and informed him that he had some personnel issues that he needed to tend to and wasnt sure if wanted to continue playing football From what I understand of his situation I understand where he is coming from Gruden said You know there are some issues there that he has to take care of and only he can take care of him the way he sees fit But as far as owing things to us he has given everything he has had since he has been here We have taken some time to try to get him ready for this first game but I think sometimes your personal life is more important and in this case for him it is Gruden said that veteran safety DeAngelo Hall has been among the players that have reached out to Cravens over the last 48 hours Hes done a great job of trying to communicate with him and help him Gruden said The rest of the guys have too Hes made a lot of friends here since hes been here a year and a half or two years however long its been He knows that were all here for him if he needs us but I think he just needs some time for himself to figure out what he wants to do From a football standpoint Cravens entered his second season in Washington pegged as the teams starting strong safety In 11 games during his rookie season the 2016 secondround pick recorded 24 tackles along with five passes defensed one sack and one interception Cravens sealed the deal for a Redskins victory in Week 3 over the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford NJ picking off Eli Manning in the final seconds of the game I think he wants to play Gruden said Ive seen him at USC Ive watched him at practice Ive watched him play in games and I know that he loves the game of football so I dont think that is the issue I just think that there are some things really weighing on his mind that he has to take care of So if he gets those things cleared up then sure we will take another look at him He is one of our guys At least for the next month the Redskins will look to Deshazor Everett as the starting strong safety Everett started the final three preseason games in place of Cravens recording nine tackles and a pass defensed Gruden is confident in Everetts abilities to take over the strong safety role pointing to the 25yearolds steady progression over the years He is one of those guys like I said before moved from corner and that takes some time but I think the more reps he gets with the first group I think the more detailed oriented he is going to be in the film room and studying Gruden said He is a very passionate guy about the game I think he will do a good job Its just a matter of lining up correctly getting the calls communicating with DJ Swearinger and making plays I know the one thing he can do he can tackle He is not afraid He has got good ball skills So thats a good combination for a safety', 'The Redskins will have four captains two offensive one defensive and on special teams leading the way for the 2017 squad during the regular season The Washington Redskins will have four captains for the 2017 regular season Quarterback Kirk Cousins and tackle Trent Williams are once again offensive captains safety DJ Swearinger is the defensive captain and tight end Niles Paul will serve as the special teams captain Captains are selected based on votes from teammates Cousins is entering his third season as the Redskins starting quarterback and second as a team captain Since taking over the role as starter entering the 2015 regular season opener Cousins has guided the Redskins to a 17141 record passing for more than 9000 yards with 54 touchdowns to just 23 interceptions During the 2016 season Cousins set singleseason franchise records in attempts 606 completions 404 and passing yards 4917 while becoming the first Redskins quarterback to appear in the Pro Bowl since the 1999 season Additionally Cousins is the first player in franchise history to win multiple NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards Dec 2015 and Nov 2016 As hes grown as a player on the field over the last two years Cousins has also become more comfortable in a leadership role I think hes earned that right and that respect said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden of Cousins leadership role That takes time for a young quarterback thats competing to be a starter and find his way in the NFL You just dont do that overnight I think now that hes established himself as a starting quarterback in the league and for this football team I think he feels more comfortable especially now that he feels good with the system Williams meanwhile has been voted a team captain for the seventh straight season One of the top tackles in the league today Williams once again gathered Washingtons offensive linemen in the offseason for a grueling weeklong series of workouts in Houston Despite being at the peak of his game Williams decision to reunite Hogs 20 showed other players that hard work no matter the skillset pays off in the long run Its also good to see a guy with that type of talent and skill set work as hard as he does Gruden said That rubs off on the younger guys the guys that are up and coming young players They see a guy like that with much talent that much production over the years and Pro Bowls work that hard you know it makes the other guys say Hey I better work harder because Im not as talented as him So its great to have him Hes a great leader and hes going to keep going Defensively Washington has selected Swearinger as the defensive captain and its fairly understandable as to why Not only is Swearinger providing the Redskins an experienced safety in the defensive backfield hes easily the most vocal player on the field each and every day You know it helps everybody out said safety Deshazor Everett of Swearingers vocal ways on the field It makes me want to talk more I see that DJ talking helps out everybody else so let me talk while Im out there So I can help everyone help everybody else As for Paul he once again has been named the special teams captain as was the case a year ago Despite being in his seventh season with the Redskins now Paul continues to take pride in his special teams play Special teams is how Ive made my bread and butter over the last few years and throughout my career here Paul said Its a part of my versatility as a player because I take pride in special teams Its kind of like the linebackers the linebackers have their wolf pack but the special teams have their wolf pack Everybody on that unit takes great pride and we just want to make this one of the best special teams units

multiyear contract extension on Tuesday Chris Thompson can finally relax knowing his home will continue to reside in Washington for at least another few years The 26yearold running back signed a contract extension Tuesday something he said had been making him nervous for days now I felt like a kid going to school for the first day Thompson said I couldnt sleep I was ready to give up and come here this morning I wanted to cry last night because I knew this was coming this morning Little bit of mixed emotions but of course Im happy about it Thompson had been previously playing under a oneyear tender he signed in the offseason Now that a longerterm deal has been inked Thompson expressed his eagerness to focus purely on football Im just glad we were able to get something done and thats out the window now he said I wasnt worried about it earlier I was just focusing on having a great year this year but now thats out of the way I feel good Thompsons transition to the NFL was anything but smooth after being drafted by the Redskins in the fifth round in 2013 During his rookie season the young tailback underwent shoulder surgery keeping him off the field for a large portion of the year He failed to make the initial 53man roster in 2014 and spent time on the practice squad before finally getting an opportunity to see some game time later that year His amount of carries nearly doubled from 2015 to 2016 and he averaged 55 yards per run through the two seasons earning him the title of security blanket on the offense Just being consistent thats been my biggest focus just trying to be consistent and just being the same guy being the same player every single day Thompson said Head coach Jay Gruden one of Thompsons advocates expressed his delight in the extension and praised his running backs work ethic Hes a coachs dream quite frankly and you want those guys to succeed because it trickles down in the building Gruden said Guys like that when you see them get rewarded the younger guys see what it takes to get rewarded and it rubs off on the younger players So its great to have a leader like Chris Gruden also said that while there may be some bigger names at running back on the roster there were few more dependable than Thompson especially in the red zone and on third down Through four seasons Thompson also acted as another weapon for quarterback Kirk Cousins in the passing game snagging 90 receptions and five touchdowns Weve gotten to the point where Kirk trusted me Thompson said Thats what every receiver running back wants from their quarterback to just have that trust in you The coaches trust in me and thats all I ever wanted Though he received support and encouragement from the coaching staff and team during the offseason Thompson said there was hardly ever a moment where he felt his job was completely secure He said he recognized the uncertainty that comes with playing in the NFL but was glad to have a home for the next two years I had my doubts I had them all along ever since I made it in this league Thompson said I started to improve my last couple years so I figured something would come along and we were finally able to get something done Like I said before Im happy about it Im excited about the opportunity to be here with my boys a little longer', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles Wednesday Sept 6 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center OFFENSE DEFENSESPECIAL TEAMS', 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Hes done a better job handling the burnout from preseasons past One of the concerns that quarterback Kirk Cousins had after last season was his stamina He noticed that he didnt balance his time and energy in the most efficient way leaving him feeling a little burned out facing the Steelers for the season opener As part of his ongoing evolution as a starting quarterback Cousins took better care of himself during training camp and the preseason managing how much energy he exerted throughout the grind of August I would say Ive done a better job managing it Cousins said I feel that each year Im going to get better at handling my role and how to be best prepared each week Its been a good offseason Im ready to go Feel like the last six weeks through training camp and through preseason games its never been perfect but its been a good six weeks Weve done all we can to be ready for this first game Cousins did also mention that while his wife is expecting a baby very soon he will react accordingly which is a different kind of preparation I think the plan is to not have a plan Cousins said In a sense that if I can be there Im going to be there if I cant I cant Im going to get there as fast as I can whenever my commitment is over 2 Hes still comfortable with Josh Doctson despite not playing with him much over the past month The most concern the offense might still have is how wide receiver Josh Doctson will fare after a lingering hamstring injury has sidelined him for most of the preseason Hes missed all but three games over the last year including a preseason game this year which has cut down on time Cousins has had to gain a rapport with him Still Cousins says hes comfortable with Doctson lining up with the offense crediting his natural abilities as a receiver to help transcend the time lost He was able to watch last year and sit in on meetings and learn our offense Cousins said He knows what it should look like he watched some really good players some veteran players do it last year It doesnt take a lot of time to get him going We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here We just got to continue to get him opportunities As for what kind of natural instincts Doctson has shown Cousins had a long list Natural hands tracks the ball well Hes got good speed he jumps well great size long arms Cousins said Smart player laidback personality doesnt take things too seriously in the sense that he just goes out there and enjoys the game and plays He tracks the ball really well in the air which is a tough skill to be able to have 3 The Eagles pass rush is something Cousins always has to respect Cousins said he could talk a lot about what the Eagles do on defense but he emphasized the pass rush not just the players such as Fletcher Cox but the scheme Ive always respected Coach Schwartz and their defense and the way they come after you Cousins said Just constantly put pressure even sometimes with only three or four rushers you still feel them Ive always respected Malcolm Jenkins as a safety and really the entire unit I think Jordan Hicks is a very good Mike linebacker hes a smart player you can tell hes a good leader for them Mychal Kendricks has always been a guy that plays fast plays downhill hell strike you Just a lot of respect all the way around Very versatile players that can do multiple things Its going to be a good challenge While the Redskins have won the last five games against the Eagles and Cousins has found success he also knows that the Eagles have played intelligently against them When you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience he said Its going to be a really good challenge and its what you expect Week 1 RedskinsEagles I think itll live up to how intense you expect it to be 4 He feels very good about his third down options with everyone healthy on the firstteam offense Its no question Cousins is feeling more assured about Sunday knowing he will have all of his offensive weapons at his disposal Injuries for the most part have subsided in time for the opener and while there hasnt been much time to find a rhythm Cousins is looking forward to seeing what he can do with his numerous options Part of the equation will be relying on tight end Jordan Reed and running back Chris Thompson on third downs two players who have become reliable targets when the offense is in a bind and needs a first down I dont feel a need to go look elsewhere to find somebody in those two roles Cousins said Both very natural great players Im sure it helps to have other guys who complement them Chris Thompson outside with Terrelle Pryor Sr and Josh Doctson and Ryan Grant and on and on Vernon Davis When you can have other guys thrown into the mix it hopefully keeps defenses guessing opens up lanes for Jamison Crowder and Jordan Theyre a big help to our offense They show up in big moments thats what great players do Were going to need them to do that on Sunday If we can stay healthy its going to give us a major advantage later in the year We work for that train for that and we do have some depth thats going to be an advantage for us hopefully down the road Id like to think we get all of our guys going spread the ball around let them all show what they can do and give us a lot that the defense has to focus on 5 Cousins has a new nook and personal office space at the facility and hes very excited about it Cousins posted a photo on Instagram recently about his excitement over a new small office at the Redskins facility It provides Cousins an opportunity to prepare somewhere other than the quarterbacks room which he cedes to other position groups during the week Now he has all of his papers and binders and fun trinkets in one spot and he couldnt help but smile about all of it on Wednesday I like a place to kind of leave my stuff and have notes and a white board and thoughts that I can have organized old binders that I have kept and just have them stock piled up Cousins said There really wasnt a place to do that that I could have access to it at all times We found an old nook is the best word I can think of Its really not an office but it works for me Ms Bj our secretary did a good job of getting it dressed up for me and we have talked about maybe putting saloon doors on it because there are no doors right now We were told we wont be able to put a door on it so maybe saloon doors or maybe hippie beads coming down from the ceiling I dont know On his desk sits a Jeff Foxworthy peel off calendar some Michael Scott toys from The Office and a white board with a quote from Muhammad Ali Essentially it says the fight is won or lost long before I dance under the lights Cousins said That is what he used to say so I put that there just as a reminder when Im in there that often times the game can be won or lost right here when you see something or you find a tip or a piece of information that can make a difference So it is just a good reminder I thought it was a fitting quote for what that room should be about', 'In todays Rewarding Moments In Redskins History presented by Maryland Lottery My Lottery Rewards we look back at the game that started the 2003 season when a late kick gave the Redskins an exhilarating win at home to begin the year The NFL season was finally beginning After months of anticipation and excitement football with implications was being played And the Washington Redskins were getting the opportunity to start the entire season at FedExField against the New York Jets A variety of festivities took place in the week leading up to the game including a concert on the National Mall before kickoff Once the game actually began the drama only escalated While the home team started the

Practice Sept 6 Whats Trending In Redskins Nation A Look Around The League', 'After being cut by the Falcons last week quarterback Alek Torgensen received a spot on the Redskins practice squad where he will begin his development at the position Upon his release from the Atlanta Falcons last Friday Alek Torgersen flew to New York City with a bag packed of essentials to visit some friends He waited for his phone to ring not sure if any NFL team would give him another shot until Sunday when the Redskins offered the rookie quarterback a spot on their practice squad I got the call to come here and I was ready to go my bags were packed nice easy flight from New York and it was a lot of fun he said after his first day of practice A whirlwind of emotions the lowest lows and the highest highs its been a crazy experience so far Had that call not taken place had the Redskins not waived quarterback Nate Sudfeld and no other teams found his talents necessary Torgersen was ready to travel to Oslo Norway where his father was born raised and now lives coaching a womens crew team Now hell wait to go at a later date Torgersen grew up in the same house in Huntington Beach Calif for the first 18 years of his life his mother is from Orange County but he has made numerous visits to Norway where his grandmother and aunt still live as well Despite the 12hour flights from California he tries to go back as often as possible to see them because they havent been around that much in my life said Torgersen who has never spoken the language fluently His visits provide him a unique cultural perspective that might help him as he learns to adapt to another culture in Washington For now he is understandably taking things one day at a time as he adjusts to a new environment learns a new playbook and gets to know his new teammates The University of Pennsylvania product played in the EastWest Shrine game thats where he first caught head coach Jay Grudens eyes but didnt receive an invitation to the NFL Combine in February He had to rely on a body of work that he accrued over four years in Philadelphia and a Pro Day workout throwing to receivers he hadnt played with before His credentials include being Penns alltime leader in passing touchdowns 52 completion percentage 651 and total offense 7937 yards along with being a twotime firstteam AllIvy selection I think at Penn he had a good career and then I watched every throw that he had in the EastWest Shrine game and I thought he had a good quick arm and an accurate arm Gruden said The Redskins had thought about bringing him in after the draft but were hesitant about having four quarterbacks on the roster Instead the Falcons gave him a chance signing him as a college free agent but with Matt Ryan and Matt Schaub just recently signing a contract extension ahead of him his only opportunity was to impress coaches enough so they might consider a third spot on the quarterback depth chart In three preseason games Torgersen was afforded just 20 pass attempts completing eight of them for 95 yards with two interceptions With little opportunity to find a rhythm his introduction to the NFL has been turbulent and even Torgersen said that theres a lot of mystery about me right now Coming from college to the pros its a big jump Torgersen said Youre going to take a big leap right away I felt like I made a very large leap in my game I got a lot better but I need to push myself a little more to get a little more better Initially its going to be big and these next steps are going to be smaller so youve got to look at that and find what youre doing well and remember that you are doing better Torgersens biggest goals are to work on the mental aspects of his game namely making better and faster reads and increasing his foot speed but he believes he has the talent to play in the league The adjustments will happen through osmosis experiencing an entire season with Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy asking for help and knowing that his development wont be rushed I asked him today I said Is your head spinning or how do you feel Hes handling it well Cousins said It is a lot to pick up He does a good job of understanding a lot of the big terms and techniques he really has picked it up quickly The challenge is in all the little nuances That takessometimes years Cousins even said hes been picking Torgersons brain a little bit about Atlantas offensive schemes and is enjoying meeting new people collecting new people to be able to have those relationships and hear their story and learn from them Kirks generally taken an interest in my life wanted to get to know me Torgersen said So I look forward to getting to know him a little better in these next couple months and just happy to be here Because of this new job hell postpone that trip to see his father a former crew star himself coaching at his former club in Oslo at least until the offseason Torgersen said hes not sure if he could handle crew himself but had considered taking it up if football didnt pan out after high school So far football has panned out Enough to give him another chance in the NFL Its going to take a little time a little bit of an adjustment period for me but Im ready to take on the challenge Torgersen said Its a lot fun to learn a new offense learn a new system and meet some new guys', 'Redskins head coach Jay Grudens roots in calling plays dates back to his days in the AFL Now back in the role of play caller Gruden former colleagues and current players reflect on his success The Nashville Kats were on their way to winning the Arena Football Leagues Eastern Division in the summer of 1997 Jay Gruden a 30yearold rookie offensive coordinator with a head of shaggy brown hair a bright smile and puffy cheeks toiled along their sidelines Nashvilles defensive coordinator Pat Sperduto a longtime friend and former teammate of Grudens walked over to talk before a game In his hand Sperduto clutched his call sheet meticulously organized with plays for different personnel groupings and downs and distances all typed up and laminated Hey wheres your call sheet Sperduto asked Gruden Gruden sunk his hand into one of his pockets and retrieved a crumpled page of yellow legal paper Grinning he presented it to Sperduto What is that Sperduto said Oh just some plays for me to remember Gruden replied A few scribbled notes were all Gruden needed to supplement his gut and an almost photographic memory for football plays He just has it says Sperduto now a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs Whatever it is as far as just a feel and an understanding its pretty impressive It passes through Grudens synapses on Redskins Sundays now When the Redskins kick off their 2017 season on Sunday at FedExField against the Philadelphia Eagles Gruden will again be calling the plays on offense after letting Sean McVay handle those duties the past two years Led by its passing game Washington has had backtoback winning seasons for the first time in two decades and yet it seems the organization could be heading in any direction Last year the defense was among the leagues worst The Redskins missed the playoffs Kirk Cousins future with the franchise remains uncertain If Gruden can keep Washingtons offense near the top of the league for a thirdconsecutive year that it factor might become the most compelling reason for Cousins to stay Grudens life has prepared him well for this task He began cataloging route concepts in his mind as a kid watching Joe Montana run Bill Walshs offense Over more than three decades of playing and coaching in college the Arena League and the NFL he developed quick pattern recognition In hundreds of conversations with his brother Jon in the driveway on the phone and from the press box into Jons earpiece on the Tampa Bay sideline he spitballed ideas for how to break a defense There are traces of all those experiences in Washingtons offense today The origins of a Gruden offense Gruden got to see the West Coast offense revolutionize the NFL in real time In 1977 he watched Montana quarterback Notre Dame to a national championship when his dad Jim was a running backs coach for the Irish In 1982 after Jim moved the family to Tampa for a job with the Buccaneers Jay still had a close tie to Montana through Freddie Solomon the 49ers wide receiver and the primary target on The Catch who spent his offseasons there As a high schooler with NFL ambitions Gruden spent his offseasons working out with Solomon learning the same lessons in fundamentals quarterback play and routerunning that Solomon a former quarterback was getting from Bill Walsh the other seven months of the year It was through their Super Bowl runs Gruden says Freddie Solomon was there Jerry Rice But Joe Montana was the main guy he and Bill Walsh were the guys that I really studied and followed because thats who we wanted to win you know Grudens time in the AFL helped him think creatively about play design and hone his innate ability for calling games but he says the spacing of the field about a third of the size of a regulation field is so different from the outdoor game that the schematics dont transfer over Instead Gruden inherited the core concepts and fundamental beliefs of the Redskins passing game and some of the running game from his brothers coaching tree The Paul Hacketts and Mike Holmgren and obviously Bill Walsh all those guys that Jon learned from and he used I learned from him and were engraved in my head Gruden says Watch the Redskins this season and youll still see a lot of quick passes highpercentage throws and three or fivestep drops Youll see Gruden get his running backs involved in the passing game In an average season his NFL offenses have thrown 83 passes to running backs and gained 518 yards on those plays Theyre going to hit all areas of the field You know were going to get screens nakeds boots all the things that come off the running game said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis the head coach in Cincinnati when Gruden was offensive coordinator there from 201113 Youll also see concepts that Gruden has developed on his own particularly in the deep passing game where hes come up with route combinations that are more Madden than Montana His designs have helped Cousins who led the league with 485 air yards per passing attempt and completed 475 percent of passes that traveled 20 yards or further last season grow from a game manager into an effective deep thrower That is in part a product of the personnel you cant nickel and dime with DeSean Jackson but Gruden has long been a clever architect with the deep ball We had no vertical passing game in Tampa until he got here Jon Gruden says I can remember Jay coming up with some routes you cant just run a straight go route you cant just run a deep cross every time you have to come up with some different types of vertical passes and Jay was really good at helping us do that Jon posits that the AFL did influence his brother schematically in at least one way Receivers cant run out of bounds in the AFL because when Jay played and coached there were only inches of space between the sidelines and the hockeystyle boards enclosing the arena Running straight down the field wasnt a good option Youd run right into the boards and break your neck Jon Gruden says Know what I mean But you can start across the field and then put your foot in the ground and then go back deep where you came from to the opposite pylon When Jon Gruden finally coaxed his brother into coaching with him in Tampa in 2002 Jay used his understanding of spacing and leverage to come up with all sorts of deep angles routes called rage or star routes or code reds He came up with all these crazy vertical double moves that I certainly hadnt thought of Jon Gruden says A long history of calling plays This offseason Gruden has fielded a legion of questions about his return to calling plays His responses have contained traces of confusion and annoyance like hes being asked over and over if hes comfortable breathing His brothers reaction is sharper If Jay Grudens not as good a playcaller as anybody in the league I mean I disagree Jon Gruden says I know what he knows I know what hes done and I know what his role has been in Washington Its not like he just stood there with his foot in his mouth the last two years Come on I mean give me a break Gruden was the Redskins offensive playcaller in 2014 before McVay was given that title and responsibility He called plays in Cincinnati too Finding the start of Grudens playcalling days though requires going back much further Back even before he was on the sideline in Nashville Back to when he was a player Gruden chose Louisville for college in part because of coach Howard Schnellenbergers prostyle offense which asked a lot of him as a young quarterback And when he was with the Tampa Bay Storm coach Lary Kuharich insisted that quarterbacks call their plays I dont know if theres many people out there that have that ability like Jay does where it just came so easy and so natural to him says Sperduto In addition to coaching with Gruden in Nashville Sperduto was one of his linemen in Tampa Bay As teammates they won multiple ArenaBowl championships in the early 1990s It was clear from being in the huddle with Gruden Sperduto says that he knew how to minimize an opponents best pass rusher or motion to get a mismatch and that it all came naturally to him at gamespeed By the time Gruden was calling plays off crumpled sheets of paper in Nashville he was already comfortable as a playcaller He was very aware of everything that was going on in the game and he knew how to attack personnel knew a great deal about the opponents personnel and where the weak spots were says Ed Khayat the former Redskins Eagles and Boston Patriots defensive lineman who hired Gruden as coach of the Kats in 1997 When Jay Gruden joined his brothers Buccaneers as an offensive assistant in 2002 he got a chance to use that awareness in the NFL game Jon and Jay Gruden were connected by their headsets Jon on the sideline and Jay watching from the press box for seven years Even in his first year with the team Jay Gruden didnt hesitate to speak up during a critical situation Jon Gruden remembers one play during Super Bowl XXXVII which the Buccaneers won 4821 against the Oakland Raiders where Jays it factor was on display The Bucs were already up 10 points before halftime and facing a firstandgoal from the Raiders 5yard line Jay Grudens voice shot into Jons earpiece Hey Get to 374 Wasp Jon Gruden called it Bucs wide receiver Keenan McCardell split out wide to the right and ran a fly route right at Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson then stopped Quarterback Brad Johnson made the throw and McCardell caught it over his back shoulder for a touchdown It stung them pretty good Jon says The task this year Right now the Redskins future is murky The offseason was defined by changes made to the defense which must improve for the team to have success But if Washington remains in the playoff picture and posts a thirdconsecutive winning season itll likely be for the same reason as last two they scored points Should those things happen the comfort of an offense thats helped him pass for 4000 yards in backtoback seasons and a coach who has backed him and helped him succeed may be the Redskins best chance to convince Cousins to stay Its not fair to put that all on Gruden but whats fair is not always whats relevant at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va Its also not accurate to say that Washington needs only to recreate its offensive output of the last two seasons to have success Weve got to figure out a way to be balanced Gruden says Not just at the beginning of the year but at the end of the year I think sometimes when you have so many weapons everybodys like Man Jordan Jamison Josh Terrelle Just throw the ball every snap But I think our offense is best when we can run the ball be physical Historically Gruden hasnt been as passhappy as his reputation indicates Only twice in the last six seasons has a Gruden offense ranked in the top half of the league by passing play percentage One of those seasons was 2016 in Washington however when the Redskins threw more often than all but seven other teams That imbalance put up numbers but it also led to problems most acutely in the red zone The Redskins were 30th in the league in touchdown percentage inside the 20yard line where Cousins completion percentage dropped from 67 to 4578 I think Jays one of those guys thats going to go off feel says starting running back Rob Kelley If he feels like were killing in the run game hes going to run it If he feels like were picking up in the pass game hes going to pass it Hes one of those guys where youve got to show him that you can stop it The Redskins will try to rededicate themselves to the ground game If that succeeds they hope it will help their play action game as well a strength of Cousins Beyond those things the Redskins offense wont look terribly different this year to the average viewer Its always been Jays offense at the end of the day Cousins says So even though Sean was involved in the past the fact that Jay is the one calling it now theres not a lot of change because it was always Jays system And he was very involved in the gameplanning and even in the gameday play calling decisions And yes they will still throw the fade I only called it like six times all year for Gods sakes Gruden says Its just they were 0for6 Selfdeprecation aside hes serious Just watch Cincinnati tape Gruden says The reason Im sitting here today is because we threw the fade He loves the fade confirms AJ Green A constant competitor Gruden still uses the word quit to describe his decision to go into coaching Back then in 1997 his goal of playing quarterback in the NFL still felt within his reach He had a young family to support though and wanted to give them security Had he gotten hurt playing hed have lost his source of income Khayat offered him a 57000 guaranteed salary as offensive coordinator in Nashville Gruden took it Gruden is glad he made the choice to give his wife Sherry and their three boys stability He was around to coach his sons basketball teams and go to their school events Still stepping off the field was hard I loved playing so much Gruden says It was hard to walk away because it didnt make sense to Gruden that multiple AFL titles as a player hadnt gotten him more than a developmental squad stint with the Dolphins that was so short he never got a playbook Hes still bitter that he never got a shot in the NFL Jon Gruden says I still think hes mad at me because I didnt sign him as a player He said What do you mean coach Im better than Donald Hollas I can still hear him saying I can beat out Ty Detmer in Philadelphia Grudens awshucks exterior sometimes masks this but hes a competitor who sees everything as an opportunity to show hes a winner Sperduto recalls 20minute arguments over who called a Jeopardy answer first At the NFL Combine this March Gruden sought him out in the stands of Lucas Oil Stadium and told him to download Words With Friends so I can whoop your ass Competitive banter has always been a hallmark of Grudens personality Hes the same person he was in his 20s playing for the Storm teasing Sperduto and his other linemen after they let him take a hit You honestly felt guilty not protecting him to the fullest says Sperduto recalling the pit hed feel in his stomach watching Gruden pick himself up off the turf You really felt like it was letting him down Im Italian Ive got that Italian mother guilt complex he plays on that big time Like Dont worry I dont need my back Youd feel so guilty Sperduto recalls As a coach Gruden still motivates with that biting sense of humor When Gruden came to Washington in 2014 some players mistook his easy demeanor for a lack of discipline or intensity Now entering his fourth season his contract extended through 2020 Gruden has grown comfortable being in control Im comfortable with people around me Gruden says We have a great staff and Ive gotten to know the players My first year here I didnt know anybody playerwise Nobody And theyre set in their ways and Well we didnt do it like this last year But I think everybodys gotten to know me a little bit more and I think everybodys more comfortable being around each other Now the Redskins often describe Gruden as a players coach Most in the locker room feel a sense of loyalty to him They say he hasnt forgotten what its like to be in their shoes When they dont succeed I take it hard Gruden says I feel like I let them down There are complications to having it Expectations for the talented can lead to extreme personal demands Did he do enough Did he do it right Even though he was the one to call for 374 Wasp Gruden keeps his Super Bowl XXXVII ring locked away at home because he doesnt think his contribution earned it Dozens of people and thousands of hours have helped Gruden get to where he is now His innate ability along with a few disorganized notes began his run from coaching for stability to chasing a Super Bowl ring he can call his own He has formulated one of the leagues top offenses as the primary mode to get there creating both a benefit and complication with his starting quarterback The upbeat presence of a rookie coordinator remains Its the surroundings and demands that have changed Read more Washington Redskins coverage in The Washington Times', 'The Redskins knew thatd have tough decisions to make when slicing down the roster to 53 players and the wide receiver position resulted in talented players being placed on the practice squad With the 53man roster set for the time being Washington Redskins head coach Jay Gruden heads into Week 1 with a group of five wide receivers a downsize from the six wideouts he had at his disposal last year This years opening day receiving corp will consist of Terrelle Pryor Sr Jamison Crowder Josh Doctson Ryan Grant and Brian Quick While the position projects to be a strength of the Redskins in 2017 Gruden elected to go with a smaller group of receivers to free up other positions on the roster The top four receivers should not come as much of a surprise Pryor Crowder Docston and Grant were all expected to make the team from the outset of camp The battle for the fifth and final spot on the wide receiver depth chart however was much more intense There were some tough decisions five receivers two quarterbacks only four tight ends Gruden said on Tuesday We would love to keep about 56 players but we had to get down to 53 and thats the best way we decided to do it Quick ultimately earning one of the spots on the 53man roster beating out the likes of seven wideouts that were let go in the final round of cuts Playing in his sixth season out of Appalachian State Quick came to the Redskins in March after a career year with the Los Angeles Rams notching personal bests in starts eight receptions 41 and receiving yards 564 He was one of the better receivers this preseason for the Redskins as well ranking second on the team in receptions with seven Gruden explained that one reason for moving forward with the current group of five wide receivers is a result of the depth he sees elsewhere namely at the tight end position With the four tight ends that we have we dont have to be in threereceiver sets we can be at tworeceiver sets more often or maybe even a onereceiver set he said So we got it covered A group of four tight ends led by former Pro Bowlers Jordan Reed and Vernon Davis can certainly help take some pressure off of the receivers Redskins tight ends accounted for 26 percent of the teams total targets last season despite missed time from Reed As far as depth goes the 28yearold Quick edged out a wellregarded group of wide receivers including Maurice Harris Dres Anderson and Robert Davis all of whom will begin the season on the practice squad Harris received praise from Gruden Last season Harris developed on the practice squad before being called up to the active roster in October He finished the year with 10 catches for 66 yards Maurice Harris is here so we feel good about him at any time any place anywhere Gruden said He could be a top three for all I care Hes a very good player Were fortunate to get him back Despite downsizing to a fiveman core for now the talent will seemingly still be there at wide receiver this season The team experienced a few flashes of greatness from 24yearold Crowder last season most notably when he amassed 442 yards and three touchdowns over a fivegame stretch Pryor will be welcomed into the team after he has a breakout season in Cleveland catching 77 passes for 1007 yards Additionally Doctson has yet to truly show Washington fans what he can do on a football field after missing essentially all of last year with an Achilles injury While the numbers might be fewer the weapons are still there for Kirk Cousins and Co to put a dynamic offense on the field in 2017 One of the benefits with this group of wide receivers is their collective ability to play all three wide receiver spots If you play a tworeceiver set right now Crowder could be the starting Z it could be Josh it could be Ryan Gruden said last month We have plenty of options there The big thing is we want to keep them fresh If Terrelle gets tired I wont hesitate at putting Josh at X or Ryan Grant at X or whatever so we have a good group of wideouts that could play anywhere at any time', 'Focused on contributing for the Redskins in 2017 secondyear wide receiver Josh Doctson is excited to return to the field Quarterback Kirk Cousins is ready to see him unleash his skills on opposing defenses Perhaps no Washington Redskins player is under more pressure to perform during Sundays regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles than wide receiver Josh Doctson Doctson of course was Washingtons firstround pick in the 2016 NFL Draft after a tremendous senior season in which he was named a consensus firstteam AllAmerican The 6foot2 206 pounder barely got a chance to showcase his brilliance as a rookie though catching just two passes for 66 yards before being placed on seasonending Injured Reserve in October as he dealt with nagging Achilles injury He would return to the field healthy in the spring and flashed during the early portions of Washingtons training camp but a hamstring injury sidelined him for the preseason opener and the Redskins preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals a game in which the starting offense played more than a half Despite the injuries and mounting expectations from the fan base to perform Doctson appeared at ease on Wednesday when he talked with reporters about this weeks NFC East battle Its just exciting to be able to prepare like this and to be ready to play on Sunday said Doctson who has been a full participant at practices this week Any chance to get out there on Sunday for anybody is exciting Im ready Even though Doctson has dealt with various injuries in his short NFL career to date Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said the 24yearold has never lacked confidence He just hasnt been 100 percent healthy Gruden said Hes a very confident player He was the top receiver in the draft we thought He made a huge impact in college football when he played at TCU So I think confidence is not an issue with Josh From a talent standpoint Doctsons fluid motions make him one of the most natural route runners at the wide receiver position In Grudens offense timing and tempo of routes is key As time goes on and Doctson remains healthy the hope is that he becomes and reliable target for quarterback Kirk Cousins He runs and gets in and out of his breaks smooth Gruden said He gets his head around Hes at the right depth He understands the route tree very well He knows how to run everything Theres not a route that he cant run Well see how it goes but I feel very good about where he is as far as mentally and his approach to running routes at receiver When Cousins was broached about Doctson at his weekly press conference on Wednesday the quarterback was quick to point to some of Doctsons best attributes Among them natural size great hands and topnotch ball tracking abilities So even though Doctson has now missed six preseason games and 14 regular season games to date he has the skillset to thrive once healthy I feel pretty good because Josh is a natural receiver and has done it a long time Cousins said He was able to watch last year and sit in on meetings and learn our offense He knows what it should look like He watched some really good players some veteran players do it last year It doesnt take a lot of time to get him going We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here Weve just got to continue to give him opportunities', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the

league and together on the same Dline theyre going to present some challenges Weve just got to be ready to roll One of the areas of concerns surrounding the Redskins offense has been the running game

total yards on the ground Long did not participate in those games but stepped aside to let backup Chase Roullier lead the offensive line Long said he was impressed with the way Roullier rose to the challenge and improved in each contest Chase did a great job He stepped up in there without a hitch Long said Our offense is running smoothly and played great against the Bengals I think that while hes up our coach is saying Weve got a good backup Hes someone who can be a starting center caliber in this league The dynamics of the game will change dramatically come Sunday when the starters retake the field and the offensive line is pitted against Philadelphias front seven Long while acknowledging his own contributions emphasized the importance of playing as a single unit to protect the backfield Its just being consistent Long said All 11 guys clicking on all cylinders and that means backtiming on the offensive line not missing blocks the edges holding up the tight ends knowing their

yards and nine touchdowns to just two interceptions He also has a rushing score as well Despite his recent success against the Eagles Cousins enters Sundays game with a little less certainty with his weapons Unlike last season where he return proven players in DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon Cousins top two receiving targets could be Terrelle Pryor Sr and Josh Doctson Pryor is coming off a 1000yard season with the Cleveland Browns but is still relatively new to the positon He was brilliant during training camp wowing fans with acrobatic catch after acrobatic catch But he showed room for improvement during the preseason struggling to retain some of his targets Doctson meanwhile oozes talent but could not stay healthy his rookie season as he appeared in just two games Even though the 2015 unanimous AllAmerican is still somewhat of a mystery Cousins thinks his natural abilities could make up for lost time on the field We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Cousins said Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here Weve just got to continue to give him opportunities Cousins understands that the task ahead wont be easy even if Doctson is at full health making players Last season the Pro Bowler threw two pick sixes against Philadelphia They do have a good scheme Cousins said Then when you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience Its going to be a really good challenge and its what you expect Week 1 RedskinsEagles I think itll live up to how intense you expect it to be Stephen Czarda TIME TO SHINE SHAZE With safety Sua Cravens being placed on the ExemptLeft Squad list head coach Jay Gruden called upon the next man up Deshazor Everett to take his place Everett fought his way onto Washingtons active roster after transitioning from cornerback to safety His best game at safety came during the Redskins victory over the Eagles last December as he recorded his first career interception on a throw into the end zone by Carson Wentz I think he will do a good job Gruden said Its just a matter of lining up correctly getting the calls communicating with DJ Swearinger and making plays I know the one thing he can do he can tackle He is not afraid Everett will be tasked with corralling Philadelphias much improved receiving corps led by new addition Alshon Jeffery Everett will have help from cornerback Josh Norman when guarding Jeffery but when it comes to deep jumpballs Jefferys specialty the tall receiver has the height advantage Theyve got some guys that can go deep on you Everett said Theyve got some big body guys Jeffery Theyve got a guy in the slot that can do everything a gadget guy Theyve got Sproles who can line up at tailback and could split out and catch passes on screens First down second down goal line they just do it all Brandon Hill REPEAT LAST YEARS GROUND GAME PRODUCTION VS PHILLY While the Redskins were inconsistent running the ball last season two of Washingtons best ground performances came against Philadelphia In a Week 6 2720 victory Washingtons tailbacks combined for 230 rushing yards Then in December Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson each scored touchdowns as the duo combined for more than 100 yards on just 19 carries Gruden said this week that the offense despite so many weapons out wide is at its worst when theyre not multidimensional Center Spencer Long echoed the coachs sentiment saying it will take a unit effort to make sure Washingtons ground game anchors a well balanced attack Its just being consistent all 11 guys and clicking on all cylinders and that means backtiming on the offensive line not missing blocks the edges holding up the tight ends knowing their assignments Long said It just takes everybody so to have an efficient run game in this league everyones got to be on and a hat and on their assignments Thats what weve got to do Washingtons rushing attack could be a threeheaded effort with Kelley and Thompson this year joined by rookie Samaje Perine a powerful runner who set Oklahomas career rushing record last year But the group will be led by Kelley once again Washingtons starter for the final nine games last year Settled into his role this year after clawing for time at the beginning of last season Gruden expects a jump in Kelleys production He knows protections running lanes the steps the footwork and all that stuff Gruden said Hes a lot more comfortable or more natural where now he can get the ball in his hands and do his thing Been impressed with how hes progressed from his rookie year to now Stephen Czarda DONT LET THE BALL FLY OFF WENTZ HAND Redskins fans and players alike experienced the true potential of quarterback Carson Wentz in the most recent matchup between these division rivals In the teams most recent meeting the thenrookie impressed completing 32 of his 46 passes for 314 yards and a touchdown Wentz had the Redskins defense on the ropes late in the fourth quarter as well until Ryan Kerrigan s gamesealing strip sack with under a minute to go removed all doubt Wentzs performance that day represented one of the few bright spots in what was a tough second half of the season for him He claimed the spotlight early on in the season putting up passer ratings of 1010 866 1259 and 1028 in his first four games as a pro but those numbers soon began to fade His average passer rating dipped to 721 in the last nine games of the season Despite his inconsistency Wentz showed flashes of a franchise quarterback in his rookie season Hes a good quarterback he definitely is Everett said He can throw the ball well He has mobility You cant just give him a title of Hes a pocket passer or Hes a runner because hell run to create or hell sit in the pocket until hes hit and delivers a throw Thats maturity of the quarterback The 24yearold enters his second season in the league with somewhat of a new supporting cast Jeffery looks to be replacing Jordan Matthews in the top wide receiver spot after signing with the team this offseason while fellow newcomer Torrey Smith is projected to start alongside him at wideout Additionally LeGarrette Blount will anchor the backfield after his standout season in New England The Redskins need to a find a way to frustrate him so that he cant get into a tempo with a rebuilt offense We have to try to get them some thirdandlongs and put our hand in the dirt and let Ryan Kerrigan and Junior Galette and all the rest of the guys rush Gruden said Jay Cannon', 'EASY TWEET Congrats to Coach Tucker of TDKnightsFB for

last season cornerback Josh Norman will match up with wide receiver Alshon Jeffery this time playing for the Eagles The last time cornerback Josh Norman matched up with wide receiver Alshon Jeffery he went into a dark place Norman felt disrespected and took exception to Bears quarterback Matt Barkley who threw to Jeffery five times with Norman covering him connecting on three passes for 64 yards including a 37yarder at the end of the half He was also frustrated by the lack of attention referees paid to Jeffery pushing off while swallowing their whistles The second half was different Norman grabbed two interceptions the defense collected five overall en route to victory helping to rectify a challenging opening two quarters Jeffery only caught two more passes in the game not factoring into the offenses beleaguered attempts to score I dont know what it was I think it just pissed me off the situation that happened Norman said But it wasnt towards him I think it was more so towards the other guys they had on that squad But theyre not there anymore so hes not there anymore I think itd be a little different this go around Theres no animosity whatsoever Hes a great competitor though Indeed when the Eagles visit FedExField this Sunday Jeffery who signed with Philadelphia this offseason and Norman will be facing off in different circumstances Jeffery will have quarterback Carson Wentz tossing him the ball while Norman will operate in a more aggressive Greg Manuskyrun defense Eagles head coach Doug Pederson told Washington reporters this week that Jeffery will pay a significant role in the Eagle offense and hopes to get him some touches this weekend That will rely on Wentz giving his 6foot3 218 pound receiver a chance to get them Alshon makes a difference in any offense head coach Jay Gruden Hes a bigguy that can run the entire route tree very similar to what Im talking about with Josh Doctson Josh hasnt done it yet But he can go up and get the ball he can run and obviously hes very good after the catch Hes one of the star receivers in this league and hell be a big impact for them Those characteristics provide challenges for Norman who when matched up oneonone cant do much with a ball thrown a good couple of feet above him Although Jeffery acquired 821 receiving yards he only managed two touchdowns both of which came in the red zone which could likely play a factor on Sunday Hes going to run his routes Norman said I know this systems a little different than what he ran up there but still hes going to do what hes going to do His coordinators going to give him the option to do such Hes going to try and make plays for them I think thats the biggest thing that got him there Hes going to try to make plays for that offense and carry them Weve got to be mindful of that and know what they want to happen listen and be at our best Added defensive coordinator Greg Manusky Hes more of a body position guy he can go up and get the ball so well see We know what each player is and what their attributes are so well try to defend them the best we can on Sunday With Manusky sending more pressure this year certainly the entire defense will have its say as to whether Jeffery will be able to stand out on Sunday Norman knows winning a matchup is secondary to winning the game though I enjoyed the matchup every time we did it and who knows what may happen on Sunday but well go out there and put our best foot forward and to try to come out here and get a win for our football team Norman said This is the biggest thing get a win no matter who youre going up against Its all just about trying to get a win', 'Fans Can Now Receive In Stadium Video Clips on Their Phone to Share and Keep LOUDOUN COUNTY Va The Washington Redskins and social media app

his first two professional seasons The Washington Redskins this week added depth to an already solid position group claiming tackle TJ Clemmings off waivers from the Minnesota Vikings Clemmings started 30 games in his first two years in the NFL Drafted in the fourth round Clemmings was seen as a prospect with high upside after a strong showing at the 2015 NFL Combine He was tops among all offensive linemen with a vertical jump of 325 inches and a 454 20yard shuttle He also able to display his sheer strength to scouts benching 225 pounds 22 times Analysts loved his foot quickness and ability to zone in on targets in the screen game His athletic frame also allows him to peel off his block to handle any oncoming delayed blitzes and explode out of his stand to defend He is fairly new at the tackle position after playing a majority of his collegiate career on the defensive line alongside current Los Angeles Rams star Aaron Donald at Pittsburgh In his first few days in working with Redskins assistant head coachoffensive line coach Bill Callahan he is just scratching the surface of Washingtons playbook and the veteran coachs preferences Its definitely different than what Ive known to do and pretty much forget everything Ive knew and start from scratch Clemmings told Redskinscom Its very different Some of the terminologies are similar to what I know Im just learning the new terminology and what it means is going to take a little bit of time to know what terminology goes with what play Once I get that down and I know what Im doing I can think less With only a few days until opening kickoff Clemmings will continue putting in the work every day to get himself better and become acclimated with the teams playbook Everything I know is extremely and totally different from what is being taught here Clemmings said Clemmings is Washingtons fourth tackle on the roster joining fivetime Pro Bowler Trent Williams starting right tackle Morgan Moses and swing tackle Ty

report is brought to you by Inova the Official Health System of the Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins will head into Sunday regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles at FedExField in Landover Md with just three players listed as questionable and none of the 53man roster ruled out Linebacker Ryan Anderson stingerneck center Spencer Long and wide receiver Jamison Crowder hip will all be questionable for the NFC East tilt Anderson had been sidelined from Washingtons final preseason games after recording three tackles in the opener against the Baltimore Ravens He practiced on a limited basis this week as head coach Jay Gruden said hes made progress after not practicing in any capacity for a few weeks Washington of course selected Anderson out of the University of Alabama in the second round of the 2017 NFL Draft Listed as the No 2 weakside linebacker on the unofficial depth chart behind Preston Smith Andersons presence could help a Redskins pass rush that got the best of Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz last season In two games against the 2015 No 2overall pick Washington sacked him eight times including three from Pro Bowler Ryan Kerrigan Long also returned to practice this week after undergoing a minor knee procedure last month The 2014 thirdround pick out of Nebraska transitioned from guard to center last season in the wake of an injury suffered by former starter Kory Lichtensteiger Like Anderson he returned to practice this week after a tense few weeks being sidelined It was honestly pretty stressful just sitting there and thinking about all of the whatif Long said All I could do is rehab but I just miss playing ball It was kind of a humbling experience for me so it just gave me the fight to get back on the field as fast as I could If Long cant play on Sunday the Redskins will look to sixthround pick Chase Roullier to take over center duties Chase did a great job said Long of Roullier who started Washingtons Week 3 preseason game He stepped up in there without a hitch Our offense is running smoothly and played great against the Bengals I think that while hes up our coach is saying Weve got a good backup Hes someone who can be a starting center caliber in this league As for Crowder he was a new addition to the injury report on Thursday and was limited in the final two practice sessions of the week as he tweaked his hip flexor a little bit according to Gruden Anybody who is questionable is a concern Gruden said Friday We have another day of treatment and recovery and well see how he is tomorrow Crowder said that while hes listed as questionable hes optimstic about his chances to play Sunday Theres no concern Ill be ready Crowder said Just trying to get my body ready just trying cold tub hot tub whatever I have to do Like I said it wasnt nothing major from the getgo its just a little minor injury Ive planned this whole week to play Sunday If active Crowder is expected to take on an expanded role this season following the departures of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon The Duke product broke out during his sophomore campaign in 2016 catching 67 passes for 847 yards and a teamhigh seven receiving touchdowns along with 27 punt returns for 328 yards and a touchdown Ive said all along Jamison can play anywhere Gruden said earlier this year He can play outside inside He can play running back probably if he wanted to so well utilize Jamison and try to get him more involved not just in the passing game and the running game Hes an excellent player dynamic player He just continues to prove every day why we like him so much', 'The Redskins left tackle and fivetime Pro Bowler is a team captain and model of stability on the offensive line which has developed steadily over the last couple of years Before a recent practice at the team facility Trent Williams talked about keeping up with the news being a leader and the advice he gives himself every day How are you feeling about the situation in Houston Man its tragic Something you cant control Its just one of those deals where everybody has to come together and do their best for relief efforts to help expedite the recovery situation Have you checked in with your training center O Athletik I did As of right now theres no damage to O Athletik our parking lot was pretty dry but the streets leading into it were under water Have you been able to talk to people down there Yeah I talked to a bunch of people I know Everybody seems to be doing OK They just issued an evacuation for my neighborhood so well see what that means How did you feel your training camp experience was this year It was the same A good experience A good time for team bonding We got a lot accomplished How do you keep it from getting boring Well youre pretty busy all day every day So you dont really have time to get bored You get back to your room at 9301030 then youve got to be right back to the facility All the free time you get is probably used to recover and rest Youve talked about your vegan diet are you still keeping that up Laughing Plead the fifth No I had to make some changes Ive still got some of the same vegan qualities So youre still health conscious Yeah it was a trial run for me What was the biggest takeaway from that experience Just how good it feels for your body when you put the right things into it What was your general reaction to the Charlottesville news near the end of camp It was a sad situation Issues boiled over unfortunately people lost their lives and people got hurtIts America youve got people protesting anything and everything these days You never want to see anybody lose their life behind it Do you follow the news a lot I dont have time Not yet anyways I guess when I start getting some more free time probably But I watch ESPN and NFL Network Do you feel like you need to watch it with so many events happening every day With social media now its basically like a news outlet so you get all the headlines without even having to turn on the TV You say watch the news no I dont watch CNN but its pretty easy to keep up with events that are happening You use Twitter but you dont tweet a lot No Why is that Twitter can be a positive outlet and it can be a place where a lot of people lose their cool Once you put it out there you cant get it back Im not saying thats the reason I dont use it but I put a lot into it Have you just seen those issues happen to others Yeah I just learned from other people Do you feel like youre an optimist about society I try to be Being a pessimist doesnt really do you any justice in trying to move forward in life and trying to make things better I try to take an optimistic approach Its not always the case but as much as possible When you went through your suspension last year did it challenge that mindset Yeah it was challenging In what way It was something I had to go through that I didnt necessarily felt like it should have happened You try to stay positive through that How did you stay positive Just standing around the team standing around the guys They did a good job and they helped me out a lot When your leadership was questioned by the outside did you feel like that was fair Thats life The thing about it is as long as the guys in the locker room werent questioning it its really all that matters Thats who you set out to lead thats who you set out to influence Everybody on the outside can question all they want but it really has no bearing on me until you step between these doors Did you feel like you were always someone who could lead a group of men No I didnt A lot of people say naturalborn leader I probably wouldnt be in that category If you think about it the characteristics of a naturalborn leader I just havent always been that talker a guy that likes to be the center of attention In that sense no In the sense of me being able to relate to people and me being able to uplift guys and try to help people stay positive I think in that way When did you feel like that started Coach Mike Shanahan did a lot for me when I first got into the NFL Guys really dont follow words they follow actions Thats why you tend to see more often than not the captains of the team usually have the play to back it up With the NFL being such a revolving door people who do tend to stick around are the people who put out a relatively good product on the field I think that has a direct correlation to leadership Thats only half the battle Being able to relate to your teammates being able to gain their trust As an offensive lineman do you think of yourself as a protector Is that the mentality you have Protector I guess you could say that I feel like were more of a specialops unit like infantry We all work as a group and our success the teams success the offenses success it directly correlates to how we do how well we play together Do you know a lot about specialops units No Watching movies Specialops SWAT team Seal Team 6 you call in a group of guys to come get a job done nobody does it singlehandedly I feel like that more so how we come in we come in as a group with a lot of camaraderie really cohesive and our success really hinges on that being able to play together and understand each other and to have that bond I have to say Im still amazed at your Silverback gorilla back tattoo Laughing Whats the origin of that nickname It just came at school man At Oklahoma Yeah So how did that come about Its a lot of ways the attitude kind of for the most part laid back just real chill and when the time is needed switch the flip on Do whats needed How long did it take to get that tattoo 12 hours It was broken up into two sessions seven and five What do you do for all that time Shoot there aint much you can do It sucks Whats the best piece of advice youve ever received I think a piece of advice I tell myself every day is control what you can control And what you cant control dont let it worry you A lot of people worry themselves with things thats so far out of their control you cant really do nothing about it Is there an example of how that manifests for you Just everyday life You ask me about watching the news a lot of people sit and watch the news and get terrified of whats going on in the world and what decision are being made You cant control any of that Kind of like the flooding in Houston Right Mother Nature nobody can control Thats different lifethreatening stuff I noticed the other day at practice offensive line coach Bill Callahan took you guys onto the side field so you couldnt listen to music during drills Laughing Yeah Is that the worst part of his drills Yeah hes the reason the music really wasnt playing in the beginning of practice Because you like playing DJ right I aint gonna say I like playing DJ but music really does help get through the monotony of practice and helps keep the juices flowing so having the music around does help But Coach Callahan does a lot of talking and teaching He hates having to talk over the music so thats why hes against it So you just have to negotiate The only thing thats being negotiated is if he dont want it he dont want it As you prepare for the season opener against the Eagles is it clich for you to say youre ready Is there any apprehension or extreme confidence in yourself as you approach the start I dont think apprehension would be the right word Youre kind of a little nervous just because its the first game of the year These blows really count You dont want to take a loss I mean theres a lot of stuff going into it Youre not certain You know how you want the season to go and no ones certain how high it will go You dont know man theres a lot of uncertainty theres a lot of optimism theres a lot of nervous energy I feel like this is the longest part of the year if you include the four preseason games and you have a few more days all the way until this game How do you get through that to stay sharp There aint really much you can do thats why it seems so long Is the experience of walking through the tunnel still a thrill for you Its always a thrill anytime you go through that tunnel The season opener everybody is so amped up for it youve got literally months and months to look forward to what games have got to be played on the schedule Open up with a divisional opponent who weve had some battles with always adds a little more to the opening night factor', 'As the Redskins face Carson Wentz for the third time in his NFL career the defense is hoping to keep the young quarterback contained and apply as much pressure as possible Coming into his second season in the NFL Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz is looking to take a step forward with a new group of weapons around him The 24yearold is coming off of a rookie season that intertwined flashes of greatness with some bad rookie moments But with newcomers Alshon Jeffery Torrey Smith and LeGarrette Blount at his disposal Wentz is hoping to be the franchise quarterback that is often expected out of a No 2overall pick Washington Redskins head coach Jay Gruden who watched Wentz complete 32 of his 46 passes for 314 yards and a touchdown in the most recent matchup between these two teams had high praise for the young quarterbacks calm and collected demeanor Hes always looked like a poised quarterback to me He doesnt look like a rookie Gruden said this week Him and Dak Prescott were very similar in that regard they both have great poise for young players and a great handle on their offense When pressure gets around them they adjust pretty well and they handle it Hes a young player but he doesnt play young Wentz burst onto the scene last September putting up passer ratings of 1010 866 1259 and 1028 in his first four games as a pro The hype soon began to fade though as his average passer rating dropped to 721 in the final nine games of the season Outside of the stat sheet Wentzs mobility in the pocket is one area that impressed according to safety Deshazor Everett He can throw the ball well He has mobility Everett said You cant just give him a title of Hes a pocket passer or Hes a runner because hell run to create or hell sit in the pocket until hes hit and delivers a throw Thats maturity of the quarterback For Wentz its not necessarily his rushing ability that will blow you away 150 rushing yards and two touchdowns on 46 attempts in 2016 Rather it is his ability to move around behind the line of scrimmage to buy himself time that is such a key asset One thing that could potentially assist Wentzs development this season is the influx of veteran experience that the Eagles brought in this offseason Two new players at wide receiver and one at running back is a lot of new faces for a young quarterback to deal with but the three veterans should certainly add a mix of experience and talent to the roster Between Jeffery Smith and Blount that trio has combined for 255 games played in the NFL For Wentz though the next obstacle is getting a monkey off the back of the franchise a fivegame losing streak to the divisional rival Redskins Ahead of Sundays showdown at FedExField in Landover Md Gruden emphasized the importance of pass rush when dealing with a young quarterback like Wentz To do so he said the defense will have to force Wentz to throw more than hes comfortable with over the course of a game The important thing is stopping LeGarrette Blount and the running game Gruden said We have to somehow figure out how to get them thirdandlong try to make them onedimensional When were at our worst offensively is when were onedimensional', 'With the teams practice prep for the Eagles complete heres a list of the best quotes of the week as compiled by

in his foundation refusing to fall over The pass from Cousins thrown late in the second quarter hit him in stride in middle of the field providing him the opportunity to gain more speed After making one defender miss he collided into cornerback Rodney McLeod was hit by linebacker Jordan Hicks and spun to elude safety Malcolm Jenkins before sprinting to the end zone I really cant break down what happened what I was thinking Thompson said It was just something that happened on that play I was just looking to make a big play As an offense we werent prepared for them at the level that I thought we were capable of For me I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play The Redskins couldnt find their way back into the end zone in the second half a product of dropped passes and mistakes that each member of the offense took responsibility for The Redskins finished 3for11 on third down and committed four turnovers issues Thompson knows will be corrected Any time you lose that basically means that the other team played harder They executed better than you did Thompson said Going into next week weve got to play harder and beat the man across from us Thats what this game is all about winning your oneonone matchups Ive got to find a way to do that and break some more tackles and pick up my blocks better Its a lot of things we need to get fixed and I have no doubt that we will Well be alright Adding to Thompsons emotional week was the added fact of uncertainty with regards to his family which was relocated to a shelter in Tallahassee Fla due to Hurricane Irma scheduled to hit the state Sunday and into the early part of the week Thompsons mother and stepfather along with his brother and his family were moved there for safety and Thompson had planned to check in with them following the game When I heard about it my mom told me yesterday I kind of got a little nervous but then its one of those things I cant let it bother me too much Thompson said Because I know my mom shes not too worried about it shes a praying woman so I never have a doubt that shes going to be fine and whatever happens we find a way and Ill find a way if I got to do anything for my family Ill find a way to put them back into good standing', 'Landover Md The Washington Redskins have announced the following

televised on Fox with a 425 pm EST kickoff When Washington head coach Jay Gruden was 31 years old he was coaching the Orlando Predators an Arena Football League team Meanwhile McVay who turned 31 in January is already one week into a career as the youngest head coach in the NFL McVay is no stranger to the Redskins having spent three seasons in DC as an offensive coordinator under Gruden and seven total with the organization McVay now leading the Rams took the head coaching gig back in January The last time the Redskins and Rams met the latter was months away from moving back to the California

managed 430 yards after struggling with a string of foot injuries The big question for Los Angeles heading into 2017 was if running back Todd Gurley would finally flush out into the promising player that earned him a high selection in the 2015 draft Gurley had seemed to be on the edge of a breakout year averaging almost a thousand yards in each of his two NFL seasons but never seemed to hit the high mark promised by scouts Speaking of promising newcomers secondyear quarterback Jared Goff failed to look deserving of the 1stoverall selection in his debut season Goff tossed five touchdowns compared to seven interceptions in 2016 and barely broke a 50 percent completion rate While Goff is expected to start against the Redskins the young quarterback from Cal will have to face a secondary led by elite pass defender Josh Norman come Sunday making his new job that much harder On defense the Rams performed admirably in 2016 ranking as the NFLs ninth best defense However they had trouble keeping teams from scoring in the end zone sitting at 24 th in points allowed per game With Cousins and a strong company of tight ends attacking through the air Washington should be able to capitalize

After an interception return for touchdown by linebacker Ryan Kerrigan and ensuing defensive stop the Redskins offense continued the momentum near the end of the second quarter in their 3017 loss to the Eagles Sunday afternoon At the time trailing by six points quarterback Kirk Cousins and the offense put together their first real sustained drive of the game marching 69 yards from their own 31yard line thanks in large part to a titanic effort from running back Chris Thompson On the eighth play of the drive Thompson ran outside and then streaked up the right hash where Cousins hit him with a pass in stride Waiting for him in the middle of the field were three Eagles defenders all of whom were tossed aside as Thompson took a couple big hits spun and eluded the grasp of their depleted efforts He then sprinted the extra 15 yards into the end zone tying the game with less than two minutes before the half I really cant break down what happened what I was thinking Thompson said It was just something that happened on that play I was just looking to make a big play As an offense we werent prepared for them at the level that I thought we were capable of For me I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play The drive began with an incompletion to running back Rob Kelley but he took the next handoff for four yards On third down Cousins found wide receiver Ryan Grant for 10 yards to move the chains sparking the rest of the drive Cousins completed a pass to tight end Jordan Reed for five yards then connected with Thompson for a fiveyard pass that narrowly gained the yardage necessary for a first down Thompson a heavy contributor on this drive took the next handoff for a fouryard rush before collecting the touchdown pass that would ultimately give the Redskins the lead with a Dustin Hopkins field goal Thats my job said Thompson who signed a contract extension earlier in the week Ive got to make plays with the amount of snaps that I get Ive got to come in Ive got to make plays right away It got us up but by halftime we were down again For me Ive got to come in in the second half and just make more plays', 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 1 game against the Philadelphia Eagles that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 With time to take over the game with less than two minutes left Washingtons last effort ended with a fumble returned for touchdown After the defense held stout on a sixplay 33yard drive that resulted in Philadelphia only extending their lead to five points Washington had time to go into their twominute offense and strike for a gamewinning score But on the second play of a drive that started with 159 left on the game clock Kirk Cousins was strip sacked before Fletcher Cox scoped up the ball and returned it for a 20yard touchdown The play went under review as Cousins thought the he didnt fumble but the referees upheld the call on the field There are so many times where I am decisively saying Oh its worked out this way Then I go back and look at it and say Im completely wrong In the moment what do I know Im just playing Cousins said But right away I looked back the ref and went like this motioning arm forward and my arms going forward But they have time to take a look at it and get it right They made the call they made So Im not going to lose sleep over that Its the plays that led up to the moment and those are the ones that I want back That fumble was part of a difficult afternoon for the offensive unit as they finished the day 0for2 in the red zone threefor10 on third downs and had four turnovers Its frustrating Gruden said I think were better than that up front Were better than that at receiver dropping balls and were better than that at quarterback We all had our hand in it playcallers offensively it wasnt good enough obviously We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us Stephen Czarda 2 Ryan Kerrigan helped swing some momentum in the Redskins favor during the second quarter with the third picksix of his career Scoring the teams first points of the game in the second quarter Kerrigan caught Carson Wentzs pass intended for running back Darren Sproles and ran it into the end zone for a 24yard touchdown Well I got an assist from Stacy McGee there made it a little easier on me to make the catch Kerrigan said But I just had my coverage responsibility expanded with him and fortunately found the ball in my hands The picksix marks the linebackers third career interception all of which have been returned for touchdowns Kerrigan also contributed to one of the teams two sacks of Wentz who posed a challenge for the Redskins defense Clearly hes a tough guy to get down Kerrigan said I mean hes big hes athletic and we had a couple chances today where we had him wrapped up and he was able to escape like on the very first drive of the game when he launched that ball to Nelson Agholar and they scored a touchdown so I think you just got to wrap him up you got to wrap and hold on and wait for the posse to come Despite the teams overall challenges Kerrigan believes that the Washingtons defense forged a fair effort against Wentz and the Eagles offense I think by and large we played pretty well defensively a couple turnovers and we scored Alyssa Haduck 3 The defense showed glimpses of a more aggressive approach under Greg Manusky but were frustrated by the inability to bottle up Carson Wentz Throughout the offseason the defense remained open about its desire to be in more of an attacking mode under Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator after a year as the teams outside linebackers coach That was on display early as Josh Norman nearly had a diving interception on the units first play of the game before Preston Smith recorded a sack one snap later Then on third down it looked like the Redskins were going to get another sack from Jonathan Allen but Wentz slipped out of the rookies tackle attempt before extending the play just long enough to toss up a 50yard touchdown bomb It was one of a handful of plays in which the Redskins payed for not taking down the secondyear quarterback He made some good plays out there and really helped his team in tight spots said linebacker Mason Foster Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays We were

touchdowns to one interception If you dont take him down when you get your hands on him he is going to make plays down the field said cornerback Bashaud Breeland He keeps his eyes down the field Stephen Czarda 4 In a backandforth contest the Redskins struggled to maintain possession of the ball and it cost them An aggressive Eagles defense made it difficult for the Redskins offense to produce on their possessions Early in the fourth quarter an interception at the goal line on third down robbed the Redskins of a chance to score in a game in which they were only trailing 1917 On a third down throw inside the 15yard line Cousins soared a pass over the head of Jamison Crowder The Eagles would intercept the ball and end any chance of the Redskins taking back the lead at that point I mean its anytime youre in the red zone and its third down youre going to expect some kind of allout zerocover blitz and thats what they gave us and we didnt handle it very well Gruden said But anytime youre down there youre going to protect the football Youve got to be safe with the ball That was a good rush but I think the ball just sailed on him by a hair unfortunately With less than two minutes left in the game Cousins was sacked and lost control of the ball Officials ruled the play a fumble allowing Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox to recover the ball and carry it into the end zone We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Gruden said Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us The Redskins will take note of the weaknesses in Sundays performance and look to adjust and improve for this weeks road game against the Los Angeles Rams Alyssa Haduck 5 The Redskins understand that they wont get the results they want on offense if theyre not balanced Prior to Sundays game Gruden noted in one of his press conferences last week that the offense will only be at its best when theyre balancing the number of passing and running plays But against the Eagles nearly 60 percent of Washingtons offensive plays were throws by Cousins Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson combined for just 13 caries while Cousins extended four passing plays into scrambles out of the pocket as the quarterback finished the day with four carries for 30 yards In total the Redskins managed just 60 rushing yards on 17 carries Our offense is always going to hum along at a much more efficient rate when were running the ball well and we can keep the defenses unaware if its going to be a run pass or a play action Cousins said If you can honor the run then you can hopefully open up some windows in the pass game I wouldve loved to run the ball better but theres also situations in the game too that you feel like youre throwing it well or youre getting third and long and not able to run it But if youre thirdandone youre going to get a lot more rushing attempts So sometimes its just situations that determine the play calling You get less attempts in practice with being able to run the ball Kelley said the entire offensive unit needs to execute better when they plan on running the ball Ten guys do something right and one guy does something wrong it messes up the play Kelley said Its just us being a team clinging on to each other knowing that we have each others back working together and executing Stephen Czarda', 'In his regular season debut for the Redskins Terrelle Pryor Sr caught six passes for 66 yards but was displeased with his ability to catch a few more targets including an early deep bomb Terrelle Pryor Sr had a fine regular season debut with the Redskins if you are going by the stat sheet He caught six passes for 66 yards on Sunday leading the team in both categories Nonetheless he will be the first to tell you that it could have gone a lot better With less than seven minutes to go in the first quarter the Redskins were looking for a spark from the offense after Carson Wentz had ducked scrambled and launched a 58yard bomb to Nelson Agholar to open the scoring just a few minutes earlier With the ball snapped just shy of the 50yard line Redskins Kirk Cousins dropped back looked long for his tall and speedy wideout and fired away towards the end zone Pryor created separation from his defender well and put himself in a position to make the catch but the ball bounced in and out of his arms as he crashed towards the FedExField turf The play was eventually called back for holding but it was representative of the day that Pryor had It was obvious that Cousins wanted to get him the ball Pryor led the team with 11 targets but when it came to making the big play the duo was unable to make much happen I put this game on myself Pryor said I definitely let my teammates down but Im going to hold my chin up high and work harder thats all I can do Aside from the dropped pass in the end zone Pryor had two other drops in the game that he was visibly disgruntled about the first of which came on the first play of the game It was another deep pass that had the potential of going for a touchdown but Pryor was unable to haul it in I didnt even know it was thrown Pryor said I was running up the hash so I was looking up this way and all I heard was the crowd cheering so I knew it was going deep but I was like Where the hell is the ball I couldnt see It got lost in the sun Pryors last miscue came in the fourth quarter when the Redskins were backed up to their own oneyard line down 1917 Cousins who was working out of his own end zone fired a quick pass to Pryor across the middle but was once again unable to make the catch In terms of the last play when we had the ball around the one or two yard line I mean we all knowIve got to make that play at the end of the day Pryor said after the game And we had too many situations like that and I just got to be better Pryor does not attribute his firstgame struggles to any chemistry issues with Cousins chalking the miscues up as individual issues rather than team issues I just think theres certain plays that were out there today that weve got to make Cousins said You know whether its myself any other of my teammates the offensive line the quarterback things happen and we just got to make sure that were on point and we do better and thats it', 'LOUDOUN COUNTY Va The Washington Redskins announced today that they have made the following

Nation A Look Around The League', 'Linebacker Ryan Kerrigan is no stranger to finding the end zone once he has the ball notching his third career picksix in Sundays game against the Eagles When Ryan Kerrigan gets his hands on the ball watch out The 6foot4 259pound linebacker recorded his third career interception Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles While three interceptions is not a career mark that leaps off the stats page it is worth noting that all three have been returned for touchdowns Sundays installment in the Kerrigan picksix story took place after defensive lineman Stacy McGee tipped a pass from Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz intended for running back Darren Sproles The pass thrown from Philadelphias own 15yard line wobbled short of its target and instead landed in the waiting hands of Kerrigan From there it was a short sprint to the end zone for the sevenyear veteran who had a sea of burgundyclad fans cheering him on Its what you practice every day just catching the ball and taking it to the house Kerrigan said Fortunate to find myself in that situation and fortunate to make the play The picksix could not have come at a more critical moment The Eagles led the Redskins 130 and another score from Philadelphias fastpaced offense seemed imminent That kind of put us right back in the game Kerrigan said Wish we couldve ultimately capitalized I think it did give us a little momentum for a time because then we went up 1413 but ultimately it didnt do enough Turnovers plagued both teams all afternoon Quarterback Kirk Cousins threw an interception inches away from Philadelphias goal line Cousins also lost two fumbles along with Jamison Crowder on a muffed punt The Eagles were not immune either After Kerrigans interception linebacker Mason Foster recovered a fumble by Wentz but the Redskins could not capitalize on the potential momentum shift We had opportunities Kerrigan said When we had the momentum going up 1413 after Chis Thompsons touchdown if we couldve gotten off the field there and defensively not let them kick that field goal then we might be looking at a different outcome to this game Despite making a splash in the turnover battle critical third downs kept the Redskins defense on the field for too long Philadelphia went 8of14 on third down compared to Washington going 3of11 Washingtons defense looked fatigued after 34 minutes of Philadelphias offense flying up and down the field I think its just kind of like it was last year with third downs Kerrigan said Weve just got to get off the field Kerrigan also gave credit to the elusiveness of Wentz who often extended plays escaping pressure long enough to find open receivers The secondyear quarterback showed off his improved mobility on the third play of the Eagles opening drive spinning and shifting his way out of the pocket and finding receiver Nelson Agholor for a 58yard touchdown pass Wentz held on to the ball for a full 10 seconds after the snap something Kerrigan was both impressed and frustrated with He really is elusive he said We had some chances to put him on the ground and didnt That really hurt our guys in the back end On a more positive note the Redskins contained the Eagles running backs to 54 yards on the ground Kerrigan applauded his fellow defenders on being stalwarts in the running game but again empathized the importance of getting off the field something he said he was the deciding factor in the Week 1 loss I didnt think we played bad defensively he said If we can get off the field on just a couple of those third downs that we let them convert then we might be looking at a different game', 'Head coach Jay Gruden said Monday that he wants to see more consistent practice from Josh Doctson and Junior Galette before giving them more gameday snaps As is usually the case with talented players returning from injury it remains tempting for coaches to insert them into the starting lineup and utilize all of their skills right away Despite playing a division opponent last Sunday to start the season head coach Jay Gruden resisted temptation using wide receiver Josh Doctson and linebacker Junior Galette in limited capacities as they continue gain their stamina back and adapt to the rhythms of the NFL Its no question the Redskins want to utilize both of these playmakers and a seasonopening loss to the Eagles makes it feel as though their transitions should be expedited Doctson the teams 2016 firstround draft pick that has been on the poor end of an Achilles injury last year and a hamstring strain for most of the preseason played just 20 of the teams 63 offensive snaps without a target Galette who made his regular season debut after more than two years of being sidelined with two Achilles tears played in 16 of the defenses 68 snaps Sunday was an appetizer of sorts and a full healthy week of practice Gruden said on Monday will earn both of them more playing time in games You know Josh hasnt practiced a whole lot Gruden said Last year he didnt practice a whole lot This year he has been in and out of the lineup a little bit I think once he establishes himself as an everyday player he is going to get the reps and he is going to prove that he is one of our top receivers Hell get more and more reps as the season goes on without a doubt but he has got to earn that right like everybody does Gruden said that with respect to the absence of targets there wasnt anything Doctson did wrong against the Eagles just that quarterback Kirk Cousinss progressions and the plays the Redskins called didnt find him With more practice Gruden is hoping the rapport with Cousins will continue to get stronger and develop more trust which will lead to better opportunities to be targeted The more plays he makes in practice the more comfortable that Kirk will be the more reps he is going to get and that is going to happen It will happen I know that will happen Josh is a great receiver Now it is just a matter of putting it day in and day out consistently stacking days together one after another and then he will play plenty and get plenty of catches by the time the year is up As for Galette who would have tallied a sack if not for an offside penalty Gruden believes hes in a similar boat as Doctson With Galettes hamstring only recently fully healthy he wants to see the linebacker put together another strong string of practices Weve got to ease him back to make sure hes ready to go Gruden said Hes going to earn his right and get more and more reps Gruden hypothesized that this coming Sunday Galette could play 25 to 30 snaps while Doctson could play upwards of 40 but that of course will be reliant on how they perform during a condensed practice week as the team prepares for the Rams Just get these guys going make sure you dont push the envelope too far too fast Gruden said Make sure theyre ready to go and when they are ready well let them loose', 'Theres a common saying

Parks and Recreation', 'Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins struggled in Sundays loss to the Philadelphia Eagles as he had three turnovers to just one touchdown He understands he cant have a repeat performance this week After a preseason in which the Washington Redskins firstteam offense produced mixed results at best there was optimism that their fortunes would change once the regular season opened against a Philadelphia Eagles team that they had beaten five times in a row But from the getgo during Sundays NFC East tilt the offense failed to put the Eagles on their toes Four of Washingtons first five possessions ended with Tress Way punts The possession in which Way didnt appear on Kirk Cousins fumbled a ball that would be recovered by Philadelphia In total Washington scored just one offensive touchdown to three Cousins turnovers in a 3017 loss We know that as an offense that we have to play better said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Line has to play better tight ends have to play better backs have to play better our receivers have to play a lot better our quarterback has to play better The Redskins had two backbreaking turnovers in the fourth quarter when the game was still well within reach Early in the final frame Cousins drove Washington from its own 36yard line into the red zone in just four plays But on 3 rd and6 with the Redskins trailing by just two at 1917 Cousins made a critical mistake Off a threestep dropback Cousins throwing off his back foot overthrew an open Jamison Crowder as he was trying to find Terrelle Pryor Sr instead for a touchdown The ball would soar over Crowders head and into the hands of Eagles cornerback Jalen Mills who caught the ball at the goal line and returned it 15 yards Theres a play there to be made to Jamison and thats the frustrating part Cousins said We can hit that but I was trying to take Terrelle Pryor Sr to a spot that I shouldnt be trying to take him My eyes were in the wrong place and it leads to what you saw Its disappointing Youve got to be able to make that play there I think if we do we probably get the first down to Jamison if not he scores and its a different ball game Those are the plays you look at and say Ive got to be better Gruden said a similar mistake was made last year in a 3123 loss to the Arizona Cardinals as Cousins tried to find Crowder for a potential late touchdown but instead was intercepted by sixtime Pro Bowl cornerback Patrick Peterson It was the same exact route and the same exact outcome Gruden said When you have a free hitter in your face you have got to do a good job of drifting and trying to make a good throw The ball just got away from him After Washingtons defense limited the Eagles to just a field goal with 159 left in the game Cousins and Co still had time to drive down the field for a gamewinning touchdown The comeback attempt was thwarted just two plays into the drive though as the Eagles forced a fumble on Cousins and would return it for a touchdown Cousins had little time to survey his weapons as Brandon Graham was in the backfield just as the quarterback was cocked in his throwing motion Despite Cousins motioning that it was a forward pass and should have been ruled incomplete referee Brad Allen said he had lack of control in the hand thus upholding the call on the field of a fumble and officially eliminating any potential of a comeback They have time to take a look at it and get it right They made the call they made Cousins said So Im not going to lose sleep over that Its the plays that led up to the moment and those are the ones that I want back Washingtons focus now turns toward facing a Los Angeles Rams defense that smothered the Indianapolis Colts in a 469 victory Not only did the Rams hold the Colts to just nine points they became the first team in NFL history to record two picksixes and a safety in a season opener The Redskins must be at their best against the Wade Phillipsled unit to ensure Los Angeles doesnt repeat that performance We just have to keep practicing Gruden said Thats what we are out here for on Wednesdays Thursdays and Fridays We have to do a good job of getting these guys on the same page and calling plays theyre comfortable with that they can run We have to get our tight ends more involved and Chris Thompson more involved in the passing game if we have to But we will get it together without a doubt Those guys will have good chemistry sooner than later', 'An upcloseandpersonal look at the players from the teams 2017 Week 1 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles presented

1997 that ended in a miraculous overtime victory over the Arizona Cardinals After starting the season with two games on the road the time had finally come The firstever regular season game at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium now FedExField was finally played on Sept 14 1997 The Redskins were facing off against the Arizona Cardinals and looked to start undefeated in their new home The stadium was certainly broken in with style as the game was an exciting one The battle went into overtime tied at 13 following a Cardinals field goal with two seconds to play in the fourth quarter The Cardinals then won the coin toss to start the overtime period with the ball The game certainly appeared to be going the visiting teams way But just two plays into overtime defensive end Kenard Lang and linebacker Marvcus Patton hit and stripped the ball from Cardinals running back Leeland McElroy Linebacker Derek Smith then recovered the fumble giving the Redskins the ball at the Arizona 35yard line A 40yard touchdown from quarterback Gus Frerotte to Michael Westbrook then won the game 1913 the first in the new stadiums history', 'For todays Throwback Thursday moment presented by SUBWAY restaurants Redskinscom looks back at former Redskins quarterback Doug Williams recollections of two of Washingtons greatest players Joe Jacoby had a unique experience on Sept 6 1981 Not only was it his first professional game but it was the first NFL game that he had ever attended The Redskins rookie offensive tackle started that day in the seasonopening game against the Cowboys at RFK Stadium I look back on that and think I never went to see a professional football game Jacoby said I look back on it and see all these people all the fans I was used to playing in front of small crowds in college and now Im in front of 55000 screaming RFK Redskins fans I was in awe I was looking around the stadium I remember walking out and going Wow Im playing in the National Football League Jacoby played his college ball at Louisville He said the Cardinals stadium was never filled to capacity and averaged 12000 to 15000 people in attendance He topped that by far at RFK which was small by NFL standards but was always filled to the max Then the year after my rookie season we go to the Super Bowl and play in front of more than 100000 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena he said So I go from 12 to 15 to more than 100000 playing in some pretty prestigious places Jacoby was a long shot to even make the Redskins in 1981 no less start in the seasonopener Signed as a free agent out of Louisville he was initially mistaken by Redskins firstyear coach Joe Gibbs as a defensive lineman But the 67 300pounder impressed in training camp in his customary spot on the offensive line and entered the Dallas game as the starting left tackle The Redskins started 05 that year leading to questions about the quality of the team and the job status of Gibbs Jacoby said that shaky start did not help in easing his transition into the NFL But to me it was still the game he said It was a transition playing on the field as far as all the surroundings Once I was on the field playing everything else was nonexistent Showing resilience the Redskins won eight of their last 11 games in 1981 to finish 88 before romping through the league in strikeshortened 1982 and beating the Dolphins 2717 in Super Bowl XVII In the postseason that year Jacoby and his beefy teammates along the offensive line earned the nickname The Hogs They opened huge holes for running back John Riggins who rushed for a whopping 610 yards and four touchdowns during the fourgame playoff format one of the greatest postseason performances in NFL history Jacoby remembers one game during the playoff stretch a 3117 win over Dallas in the NFC championship when the lowerlevel seats at RFK were moving up and down as rabid Redskins fans expressed their distaste for the blue and silver I dont know if that was frightening but it was interesting to watch said Jacoby a fourtime Pro Bowler in the 1980s who has been a finalist for Hall of Fame induction Now all of these stadiums are so huge But to me RFK is still the neatest place We played a lot of big games back then I have a lot of fond memories', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the Los Angeles Rams Wednesday Sept 13 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center OFFENSE DEFENSESPECIAL TEAMS', 'Sean McVays rise to become the youngest head coach in NFL history wouldnt have been possible without the Redskins or Jay Gruden Now Washington will face McVay in only his second game as Los Angeles head coach Kirk Cousins couldnt exactly believe at first that Sean McVay was one of the Washington Redskins coaches during his first few days in the NFL When Cousins was selected in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft the former Michigan State product was just months away from his 24 th birthday McVay meanwhile was a 26yearold entering his second season as the Redskins tight ends coach But the two were sharing a football field at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va that spring as one was trying to pick up an NFL offense for the first time while the other was beginning an ascent up the professional coaching ranks I thought that was just unique because where I had come from at Michigan State which is all I had known at the time we didnt have coaches that were that young position coaches Cousins said We had Matt LaFleur we had Kyle Shanahan all those coaches were young at that time but they were all sharp You could see right away Sean as he coached the tight ends not only was he sharp but he knew his material inside and out There was a conviction when he taught it that what this guy is saying not only is correct but its going to help me become a better player Regardless of his age I think guys listen to him right away and people who were older than him were willing to be coached by him because they respected his knowledge for the game and his desire for them to succeed Despite being younger than some of the players he was coaching McVay clearly had a coaching pedigree that was bound for success In his first season as Washingtons tight ends coach in 2011 McVay guided former secondround pick Fred Davis to the best season of his career as he posted career highs in receptions 59 and receiving yards 796 Two years later McVay was tasked with getting the most out of a thenrookie by the name of Jordan Reed In just nine games Reed recorded 45 receptions for 499 yards and three touchdowns both franchise records by a rookie tight end In a victory over the Chicago Bears Reed also recorded Redskins rookie tight end records in singlegame receptions nine and receiving yards 134 The record was previously held by Jerry Smith who registered just 78 receiving yards on six catches vs Dallas on Nov 28 1965 After the Redskins hired Jay Gruden to be 29 th head coach in franchise history on Jan 9 2014 McVay was appointed the teams offensive coordinator at the ripe age of 28 The two have longterm ties far before their time together roaming the sidelines for the Redskins Grudens father Jim was a scout for the San Francisco 49ers when McVays grandfather John was the teams general manager Jim Gruden also coached McVays father Tim while he was a player at Indiana The bond between the two families continued in Tampa first in 2008 with the Buccaneers and then again one season later with the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League So even though McVay was young Gruden felt comfortable handing over some of the offensive duties to him When I first got the job in Washington I didnt want to just totally change the entire system Gruden said Some of the terminology in place here in the running game and some of the playaction passes and keepers and all that stuff So the dropback game we tried to implement from what Ive known from over the past with my brother and in Cincinnati and Sean has a great idea of that also because he was with us in Tampa Bay for a year and he was also with me in the UFL for one year So I felt like just from talking to the quarterbacks instead of me having to tell him what the call to the quarterback and so forth it was quicker to let him do it We came up with the game plans together and situational type football we came up together and then I still had a little bit of input but I let him handle it because he was good and did a fine job McVay of course served as Washingtons offensive coordinator for three seasons 201416 Last year Washingtons offense became the first unit in franchise history to average more than 400 yards per game 4034 and notched a franchise record 6545 total net yards They also had three Pro Bowlers on offense as Trent Williams earned his fifthconsecutive nod while Cousins and guard Brandon Scherff received their first selections The Redskins also had eight players finish the season with at least 500 yards from scrimmage DeSean Jackson Pierre Garcon Jamison Crowder Rob Kelley Chris Thompson Jordan Reed Vernon Davis and Matt Jones tying the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most in a single season in NFL history In early January McVay interviewed with both the Rams and San Francisco 49ers While most though McVay was just getting his feet wet in being a head coach candidate Los Angeles thought otherwise On Jan 12 2017 McVay became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when the Rams named him the 23 rd fulltime head coach in their franchise history I wasnt shocked said Williams who was drafted by the Redskins the same year McVay joined the coaching staff I mean you sit down and talk to him and hes knows football inside and out So its not a position its not a scheme that he doesnt know I mean he can sit up there in the box or on the sideline and basically tell you whats happening whats going to happen and why it happened And in this game many times somebody that has that type of knowledge of the game theyre going to be highly sought after His impact on Washingtons offense was undeniable Cousins even signed a jersey for McVay and left a heartfelt message about his impact It just said and theres a lot of people I could say this to but certainly to him I just said I owe you my career and then signed it Cousins said I certainly appreciate the hard work he gave to our team and as a result gave me an opportunity to be successful and it was just a smart hire by Jay to bring him in in the first place at his age Very smart by Jay to give him the role that he gave him and the opportunities he gave him and you know thats one of Jays strengths his ability to identify potential in people and believe in them maybe when its not the common thought everywhere else Its not an obvious choice Jay clearly made a really good decision there in bringing in Sean and Sean proved him right and as a result hes a head coach now So I guess when you make good decisions like that and have success you could lose those people but Seans certainly a great coach To this day even though McVay is now more than 2500 miles from the Washington DC area he remains a fan of the Redskins outside of any time Washington and Los Angeles face off Gruden and McVay remain in touch on a frequent basis including after their games last Sunday but both have assured they arent giving away any sort of competitive advantage Nobodys a bigger Redskins fan every other week than I am just because what some of those people in that organization have done for me and how theyve treated me McVay said Cant say enough about Jay Gruden and just really the mentor hes been for me This week marks the first time Gruden and McVay will face off as opposing head coaches after the latter made a successful debut last Sunday The Rams easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 469 in a historic day for Los Angeles Despite Grudens familiarity with McVay Washingtons head coach knows schematically his counterpart will find ways to keep the Redskins on their toes Gruden said hes been spending a little bit more time with his defensive staff this week in preparation for McVays offense Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations a lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of stacks and theyve got a good running game with Todd Gurley and he changes it up with good playaction passes Gruden said I can tell them what he likes but stopping it is another issue because you stop certain things but then they hit you with the running game or they hit you with the playpass or hit you with the bunchstack deal and the quick game and its a great changeup We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel Cousins added It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly In this league that tends to happen weektoweek or yeartoyear as people change and move Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Washingtons defense will face the 2016 No 1overall pick in Jared Goff along with weapons like Gurley and wide receiver Sammy Watkins who was one of four Rams receivers to record at least 50 receiving yards last week Weve got to have our heads on a swivel and play our assignments and our keys said cornerback Josh Norman Understand what they like they to do against us because offense was here and now its there Jay runs similar things and weve just got to understand that and know what they like to do and try to take that away from them Because what you see is what youre going to get Mike linebacker Mason Foster knows that the unit must be at its best or McVays offensive genius will strike early and often He can find different ways to get the matchups that he likes and thats what he did here Foster said Even when I first got here and I was playing on the scout team When I first got picked up he was always asking me about different defenses Ive played in Hes a great coach and you see why he got that job At the end of the day its the Washington Redskins vs the LA Rams and its going to be a good one Its going to be cool to see Sean it was great to see somebody that came from here doing big things but at the end of the day were going down there to get a W and thats it', 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Executing plays will overcome the familiarity that head coach Sean McVay has with the Redskins offense Eight months ago Rams head coach Sean McVay was still the Redskins offensive coordinator which is to say that hes still quite familiar with the kind of offense that Washington will be using when the team visits Los Angeles this weekend For quarterback Kirk Cousins that can have its drawbacks but it ultimately wont matter too much so long as the Redskins execute like they know they can on Sunday I think Sean McVay would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Although Cousins wasnt happy with his play on Sunday theres likely nothing McVay could have told him differently that head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh havent already discussed Its all correctable Cousins said Its all there to be fixed and its disappointing that we let one get away at home but theres nothing we can do to change it now We can only move forward and try to make the most of each opportunity we have and in preparing for the next opportunity Weve got a great challenge coming on Sunday and we can get right back where we want to be with a great performance and a win so thats where our focus is 2 McVay has meant a lot to Cousinss career and has always believed in him Before McVay left for the Rams Cousins signed a jersey for him and wrote I owe you my career on it Cousins said Wednesday there are a number of people to whom he could write that message but that McVay has never wavered in his trust of him Cousins an avid reader is currently reading Bill Walshs book and cited a passage about the former football coach who says the four most powerful words from a coach to a player are I believe in you Its the same kind of approach McVay took with Cousins working with him through the high and low parts of his career Sean said that to me over and over and over again even when there werent many other people who did so that certainly means a lot Cousins said Especially when you look back and see where we came from there Cousins elaborated on why he feels so strongly about McVay and the impact on him over the last several years Well I mean he was our play caller for my two best seasons in the league he said Im not telling you anything you dont already know I think its pretty selfevident why hes had a big impact on my careerSean has presence and its hard to teach presence He has charisma Thats hard to teach and its hard to teach being a good communicator You kind of either have it or you dont So you can talk about his age but he had presence when he was 20 years old and theres a lot of guys who are 65 who dont have any presence 3 The reads Cousins makes based on the defense are more important than the personnel around him Much was made about the amount of snaps certain offensive players received Sunday against the Eagles and how the ball was to be distributed to them This is not particularly a concern for Cousins who makes decisions about throwing the football based primarily on the defensive looks hes receiving on each play as he comes under center When they draw up the game plan they can create formations and motions and reads where certain guys may have a higher percentage chance of getting the football Cousins said But once it comes to game day unless its a complete 5050 read Im just going off what the coverage dictates and the front and what the read tells me to do and then from there what the postsnap read tells me to do It can be everybody on any given day and from week to week I think it will change quite a bit 4 Aaron Donalds return means it will be another tough task for the offensive line The Rams defensive line is considered one of the best in the NFL and it will receive a credible boost when Aaron Donald returns to the team this week after sitting out the preseason over a contract dispute Cousins hasnt studied the interior lineman too much but knows exactly the kind of presence and push he brings to the Rams defense I think that he seems to have really good leverage Cousins said He seems to be a very compact player He seems to have really good getoff off the snap count Hes quicktwitch Hes sudden He uses leverage and power Football is a game of leverage and power and he knows how to use it and get every ounce of his power and drive where he needs it to create havoc in the backfield The Redskins offensive line struggled with the Eagles pass rush allowing four sacks and several hurries forcing Cousins into quicker throws and a cluttered pocket in which to work The line will have to take step up to neutralize a pass rush that created four sacks one hit and five hurries against the Colts I do feel that every week when you look at the NFL schedule you can name a player on the other side of the ball whos dominant whos a game changing player and Aarons no different Cousins said They have a couple others as well But thats the NFL and thats why this league is so tough and also so great is because theres just such a challenge every single week 5 Timing between himself and receivers is always a work in progress Cousins explained on Wednesday that timing isnt like checking a box It requires constant tuning especially when going up against dangerous pass rushes each week As he works with his receivers to gain more trust with them the timing between them will begin to tighten up You have to kind of see it before it happens and then trust it and let it go and believe that its going to happen the way it needs to once the ball is out of your hands Cousins said That takes time and work and thats why Ive said for a long time were a work in progress Specifically looking at last Sunday Cousins is encouraged because most of the mistakes that were made were correctible in his eyes If they werent then youd be sitting here pretty nervous Cousins said But I do feel like including myself that a lot of the stuff that we didnt do well enough can be fixed and corrected and need to be So weve just got to get back out keep working never lose confidence and just prepare for the next one', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Thursday September 14 2017 delivered by FedEx Ground

Sept 13 2017 Game Information RedskinsRams Whats Trending In Redskins Nation A Look Around The League', 'The Redskins offensive line will have its hands full Sunday as an already impressive Rams defense will add defensive lineman Aaron Donald returning after prolonged contract negotiations In Week 1 the Los Angeles Rams defense held the Indianapolis Colts to just nine points Aaron Donald one of the most ferocious defensive lineman in the league watched the game play out from the sideline Granted the Colts had their own issues at quarterback and at almost every other facet of the game but keeping any NFL team under two scores is never an easy feat The Rams recorded two interceptions returned for touchdowns a safety a recovered fumble and four sacks Heading into Week 2 Donald has returned to a defense already on a roll just in time for a meeting with the Washington Redskins Aaron as weve all documented and talked about is one of the best interior lineman both against the run and the pass in the NFL and hes going to be a great challenge for us Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins said I do feel that every week when you look at the NFL schedule you can name a player on the other side of the ball whos dominant whos a game changing player and Aarons no different In three seasons Donald has been named to the Pro Bowl three times His 28 career sacks and 164 total tackles speak as to why he decided to sit out the 2017 debut Still under his rookie contract Donald is still seeking a bigger paycheck rumored to be the largest for a defensive player in the league He sat out as long as possible but in Week 2 he will be forced to return to avoid any penalty while contract negotiations continue Cousins who saw a fairly stout defense in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles acknowledged that moving the offense down the field will only get more difficult with Donald on the field Hes quicktwitch Hes sudden He uses leverage and power Cousins said Football is a game of leverage and power and he knows how to use it and get every ounce of his power and drive where he needs it to create havoc in the backfield The fourthyear product out of Pittsburgh will likely come at the Redskins offense with a vengeance intent on proving himself worthy of a new contract Rams head coach Sean McVay will be one of those Donald will have to impress McVay who spent three seasons as Washingtons offensive coordinator said he has liked what he has seen for Donald so far Meanwhile Redskins head coach Jay Gruden praised the level of intensity with which Donald plays adding that he might just know every trick in the book Hes got every move you want he can power rush you he can spin you he can rip you he gets off the snap with great tempo and hes fast Gruden said so it will be a great challenge Washingtons offensive line which hopes to bounce back after a tough showing against the Eagles will have to adjust Donalds return if it wants to keep Cousins upright long enough to complete a pass Offensive tackle Trent Williams did not seem all that encouraged by Donalds return but said Sundays battle in the trenches will just be another day at the office I wish he would have held out another week but thats the life in the NFL Williams said Nowadays everybody has these Dlines who are souped up so we just have to bring our hard hat Its going to be another tough one', 'While the Redskins applied consistent pressure on the Eagles last Sunday they couldnt wrap up quarterback Carson Wentz They realize they need better execution against the Rams Despite holding the Eagles offense to just 58 rushing yards returning an interception for a touchdown and producing a consistent pass rush the Redskins defense struggled to execute when it mattered most last Sunday That was mostly a reflection of quarterback Carson Wentz who extended plays with his feet and strength refusing to fall down after numerous Redskins defensive players had their chances to tug and wrap him to the ground The scrambling led to chaos in the secondary and Eagles wide receivers managed to break free for bigger gains the majority of which felt even more backbreaking because they occurred on third down The most costly happened on the first drive of the game with the Eagles facing a long third down when Wentz spun away from three defenders and found wide receiver Nelson Agholor wide open breaking a DJ Swearinger tackle and running into the end zone It stung even more considering cornerback Josh Norman had dropped an interception falling backwards in the end zone on the first defensive play of the game plastering wide receiver Torrey Smith on a deep route I dont know I think the plays are there Norman said We just need to make them Have the quarterback wrapped up we got to bring him down We got to have our hands on the ball We got to bring that down as well Just little things My errors my keys that I can be better in The third down struggles continued with the Eagles converting 8of14 of them six of which coming on thirdandlong It was the glaring issue in what was otherwise a solid debut for defensive coordinator Greg Manusky whose unit faced a lot of short fields thanks to four turnovers on the day The inability to get off the field on third downs was something that plagued the team last year they finished last in that category allowing for conversions 466 percent of the time For reference Tampa Bays defense was the best at getting off the field last season holding opponents to a 343 percent conversion rate Rushing the passer Got to rush the passer head coach Jay Gruden said of finding more success on third down You can play different coverages theres going to be a hole in a zone if you play zone mantoman youre going to have to buckle down and play good tight mantoman At the end of the day youve got to rush the passer You cant give the quarterback time to throw and set his feet that easily like we did Its easy for pro quarterbacks to pick you apart and find an open receiver if they have time It wasnt as though the defense didnt get pressure on Wentz Linebacker Preston Smith recorded a sack early in the game and Kerrigan and defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis teamed up for another later But many other instances the Redskins left sacks on the field He was playing backyard football scrambling around making plays with his feet defensive lineman Ziggy Hood said of Wentz Give credit to him wheres hes due Like I said it was just a tugofwar match and we lost on a couple of them A lot of their plays came from broken plays from being outside the pocket and us missing the sacks linebacker Zach Brown said If we get those sacks its totally different we just got to make sure next time we go against them our goal we think about is We got to make sure we get the quarterback to the ground That would eliminate at least three or four third down conversions and its a totally different game Both Brown and Hood said their position groups take the responsibility for the breakdowns in coverage noting that receivers will usually have an easy opportunity to get open when a quarterback is given eight seconds to roam around in the backfield Norman would agree but also realized that the defensive backs were in position to make a couple of interceptions on Sunday too As the Redskins prepare to take on the Rams and limit quarterback Jared Goff they can feel confident in the talent they have on the field and the game plan to stop Los Angeles They just want to make it all count You put all that work into getting into that point of attack and then youre there but you just got to finish the play Norman said Thats the easy part Just finishing I think the hardest part is getting to that Once you can you just got to capitalize and be great',

ON THIRD DOWNS Simply put the Redskins werent good enough on third downs on both sides of the football in Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles The offense was 3of11 27 percent on third downs while the defense allowed the Eagles to convert on more than half of their tries 8of14 Washingtons defensive unit actually was stout in short distances on third downs as they held Philadelphia to just 2of4 on third down attempts with five yards or less needed to move the chains But the Redskins allowed the Eagles to convert on half of their attempts of 3 rd and8 or greater yardage On the Eagles first third down of the game it looked like the Redskins were going to force a threeandout But two near sacks werent enough to take down Carson Wentz who launched a 58yard touchdown bomb on 3 rd and12 To stop such plays the Redskins need to get home and finish their plays especially with the quarterback in their grasp Rushing the passer Got to rush the passer said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden You can play different coverages theres going to be a hole in a zone if you play zone mantoman youre going to have to buckle down and play good tight mantoman At the end of the day youve got to rush the passer You cant give the quarterback time to throw and set his feet that easily like we did Its easy for pro quarterbacks to pick you apart and find an open receiver if they have time Offensively the Redskins cant make the same mistakes they did last week on third downs if they want to score their first victory of the season The unit was 0of2 inside the red zone and a critical third down interception by Kirk Cousins took points off the board We have to do a lot of things better Gruden said We have to protect better We have to throw the ball better We have to run better routes So it is just a combination of things I have got to call better plays I have to call plays that are conducive to those situations and the coverages that we are going to see by percentage and then we have to protect So a little bit of everything Stephen Czarda BE ON YOUR TOES AGAINST AN OLD FOE Redskins head coach Jay Gruden is on a collision course with his former offensive coordinator Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay and Gruden will partake in a game of minds during Sundays matchup at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Gruden and McVay both offensive minded coaches face the unique challenge of balancing both familiar schemes while also incorporating ones their opponent has never seen We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly Gruden said Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Cousins on the other hand said he was more focused on the Rams players on the field rather than the coaches on the sideline According to him thats where the real battle will be on the turf I think Sean would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Cousins had his best year in McVays offense in 2016 throwing for 4917 yards and 25 touchdowns McVays impact can already be seen in Los Angeles where second year quarterback Jared Goff earned his first career win in Week 1 throwing for 306 yards and a score with no interceptions Brandon Hill GET READY FOR AN ALLPRO RETURN After holding out for the entirety of training camp and all of the preseason Rams AllPro defensive tackle Aaron Donald returned to the teams headquarters last weekend and will make his season debut Sunday against the Redskins Contract negotiations aside Donald is one of the NFLs top defensive players Selected in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft Donald is a threetime Pro Bowler twotime firstteam AllPro and was the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year at one point too In total hes recorded 164 tackles with 29 sacks seven passes defensed and four fumbles forced in his career to date Even though he hasnt played in an NFL game since January Were assuming hes playing 70 snaps Gruden said He doesnt come out in nickel he probably wont come out in base I dont know why you would take him out Im sure hes in good shape so I imagine well see a lot of Aaron Donald Regardless of how many snaps he appears on the Redskins know what sort of impact he can make In two career games against Washington Donald has totaled nine tackles with 15 sacks I wish he would have held out another week but thats the life in the NFL said Redskins tackle Trent Williams with a smile Nowadays everybody has these Dlines who are souped up so we just have to bring our hard hat Its going to be another tough one Stephen Czarda MAKE EM ONEDIMENSIONAL Coming off a disappointing 2016 campaign thirdyear running back Todd Gurley still offers the same explosiveness and vision that made him one of the most exciting young players in the league as a rookie The 2015 Offensive Rookie of the Year burst onto the NFL scene after an impressive career at Georgia After being selected at No 10 overall in the draft he lived up to his high expectations in his first year running for 1106 yards and 10 touchdowns While his numbers took a dip last year he still maintains an impressive set of tools argues Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a big threat He is still a good running back Gruden said this week He has great vision good sight lines He has got burst through the hole He is a good back Gurley kicked off his 2017 season with a soso performance last week against the Colts He struggled for the most part in the running game rushing for just 40 yards on 19 attempts but found the end zone once While he was unable to get much of anything going on the ground quarterback Jared Goff completed five passes to Gurley for 56 yards It was somewhat of an underwhelming performance as a rusher for Gurley but Gruden noted that he had a couple runs that were called back due to penalty Still in an offense that has a multitude of young and new faces Gurley remains a focal point Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations Gruden said A lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of stacks and theyve got a good running game with Todd Gurley and he changes it up with good playaction passes Jay Cannon', 'With the teams practice prep for the Rams complete heres a list of the best quotes of the week as compiled by Redskinscom presented by GEICO 10 He is organized and detailed number one He was with me and my brother in Tampa and he was with me in the UFL so he knew what I like to run Very smart very detailed He also had a good grasp on what they did here in previous years with Robert Griffin III and Kirk Cousins So we tried to kind of mix and mingle our two systems together He was a big part of that so I felt good about him calling plays and we scripted together well not scripted but we game planned together and got our situational stuff down So it was a steady good flow that he had about him I didnt have to step in a whole lot I did from timetotime but he is a good play caller We just kind of let him roll with it Head coach Jay Gruden on having confidence in Rams head coach Sean McVay 9 Its his first goaround I think hes going to learn just like every player and coach does from every year that they compete in Hes going to get better over the year and were expecting great things from him Defensive Coordinator Greg Manusky on Jonathan Allen s first game 8 He has a lot of different variations a lot of different stuff hes going to throw out at you Its something that weve been going against since Ive been here the last three years Its going to be exciting Its a big game in LA in the Coliseum Thats what you dream about Its going to be fun and well be prepared Linebacker Mason Foster on preparing for the Rams 7 So many third and long plays we just got to make sure we take him down and get the sacks because a lot of their plays came from broken plays from being outside the pocket and us missing the sacks If we get those sacks its totally different we just got to make sure next time we go against them our goal we think about is We got to make sure we get the quarterback to the ground Linebacker Zach Brown on executing on third down plays 6 It doesnt even matter about last year If its on my schedule next Im going to prepare for you the best I know how Ill continue to prepare and be ready on Sunday Safety DJ Swearinger on not being as familiar with McVays offense 5 Im pretty sure they have something new cooked up for us He knows what coach Gruden knows They have something cooked up they have a game plan We just have to go out there play technique and be fundamentally sound as far as doing things right Theres going to be a couple runs a couple passes that were not going to see We just make sure we play our technique and that will lead us in the right direction Defensive lineman Ziggy Hood on the Rams offense 4 Sean meant a lot to my career I signed a jersey for him when he left and it just said and theres a lot of people I could say this to but certainly to him I just said I owe you my career and then signed it I certainly appreciate the hard work he gave to our team and as a result gave me an opportunity to be successful and it was just a smart hire by Jay Gruden to bring him in in the first place at his age Quarterback Kirk Cousins on what McVay meant to him 3 I dont know man Im just going to do what I do every week Im going to go home and get a massage Then Im going to eat then Im going to sleep Pretty much what we do Constant routine I dont know I might get my Thursday movie in Cornerback Josh Norman on preparing to travel to Los Angeles 2 No I havent talked to him Its a game week man Im playing him right now We aint friends Cornerback Bashaud Breeland on facing his former Clemson teammate Sammy Watkins 1 I wish he would have held out another week but thats the life in the NFL Nowadays everybody has these Dlines who are souped up so we just have to bring our hard hat Its going to be another tough one Left tackle Trent Williams on Aaron Donald returning to the Rams Top 10 Quotes is presented by GEICO 15 minutes can save you more

and because Washington hasnt played in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since 1989 the teams Week 2 trip to Southern California will be a new experience for the entire organization But for some players thats not entirely true Most notably that includes wide receiver Brian Quick who played with the Rams last year and thus has plenty of experience playing inside of the Coliseum where Los Angeles will call its home until its new stadium is complete in 2019 Its a great atmosphere Quick said I played in a lot of loud stadiums and exciting stadiums but its pretty good Its going to be a great game The weather is going to be great Im just looking forward to it Those with more limited experience came primarily from Pac12 schools that had the displeasure of playing USC at least once on the road Their experiences varied most of the time they recalled playing night games in front of raucous fans but they all agreed in its main characteristic its loud I expect it to be with the Rams performance last week and us coming there with fans traveling well I expect it to be a good atmosphere Sunday said safety Stefan McClure who played at California and marveled at its design The Coliseum which opened in 1923 hosts more than 93000 people and is unique in its bowllike structure At one end zone the bowl opens up to a Memorial Court of Honor comprised of more than 50 plaques chronicling and commemorating outstanding athletes that have had an impact on the history of the Coliseum Cornerback Fabian Moreau who played in the Coliseum a few times while at UCLA was inspired seeing Reggie Bushs jersey lined up the steps towards the memorial Moreau grew up playing running back and Bush was one of his favorite players to watch For linebacker Mason Foster playing for the University of Washington in the Coliseum spurs a different kind of memory We beat them on a last minute field goal Foster remembered when his Huskies defeated No 18 USC 3231 in 2010 Its crazy man you know being from California the dream was always playing in the Coliseum because of seeing it on TV but its pretty crazy man Its a great football setting and its going to be exciting Despite the fact that a rollicking college crowd wont be present USC plays Texas the night before players expect the environment to still be loud and memorable and hope to make it more so with a victory I played there when the Trojans were good said longsnapper Nick Sundberg another Cal product I think its a little different than it has been in recent years But the place rocks man They get super loud Its a fun fun atmosphere It is very different and its got a different feel than an NFL stadium Im sure the Rams have done a good job trying to make that conversion I think everybody in this room will enjoy walking in there And after they do We says Quick just have to bring it', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the Los Angeles Rams Friday Sept 15 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center', 'The Redskins enter Sundays game against the Rams with secondyear wide receiver Josh Doctson as they only player questionable as he deals with a hamstring injury This weeks injury report is brought to you by Inova the Official Health System of the Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins head into Sundays Week 2 matchup with the Los Angeles Rams at near full heath as wide receiver Josh Doctson hamstring is the only player on the 53man roster listed as questionable Doctson was limited in practice sessions throughout the week although Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said his lightened workload was more of a precautionary measure A decision on his playing status for Sundays game and how much hell play if active will be determined following the teams flight to Los Angeles and a walkthrough on Saturday Hes just tight you know its not like its going to make him miss time or anything like that but it could limit the amount of reps that he has Gruden said on Thursday I just know hes got a tight hamstring It happens He runs a lot and like I said its not pulled so thats a good thing Weve just got to make sure we manage it and make sure he gets it loose Doctson had been limited some during training camp and preseason with the hamstring injury but was healthy for last Sundays regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles But the secondyear TCU product was not targeted on any of his 20 offensive snaps While his 20 snaps were just the fourth most among wide receivers behind Terrelle Pryor Sr Jamison Crowder and Ryan Grant Gruden said it wasnt because of a lack of readiness I think it is something more that he has to perform and he has to play well to earn more playing time Gruden said You know he hasnt practiced a whole lot Last year he didnt practice a whole lot This year he has been in and out of the lineup a little bit I think once he establishes himself as an everyday player he is going to get the reps and he is going to prove that he is one of our top receivers Hell get more and more reps as the season goes on without a doubt but he has got to earn that right like everybody does Gruden added that the more plays Washingtons 2016 firstround pick will make on a consistent basis in practice will dictate how much he plays during games The more plays he makes in practice the more comfortable that Kirk Cousins will be the more reps he is going to get and that is going to happen Gruden said It will happen I know that will happen Josh is a great receiver Now it is just a matter of putting it day in and day out consistently stacking days together one after another and then he will play plenty and get plenty of catches by the time the year is up Washington will look to get more production through the passing attack this week after the Redskins managed just 240 yards through the air in their Week 1 loss to the Eagles Cousins lone touchdown pass was to running back Chris Thompson but Pryor caught teamhighs in receptions six and receiving yards 66 while Grant had a breakout day with 61 receiving yards of his own Los Angeles meanwhile allowed less than 200 passing yards in a 469 thumping of the Indianapolis Colts They also intercepted two of Scott Tolziens 18 attempts and returned them for touchdowns', 'Check out these shots of the Washington Redskins players and coaches boarding the plane as they travel

Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum', 'Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay has been busy this offseason developing secondyear quarterback Jared Goff into a legitimate starter During 2015 all anyone could talk about was Cal quarterback Jared Goffs magic arm In his three seasons with the Bears he threw for 12195 and 96 touchdowns The Los Angeles Rams still unpacking form their move from St Louis traded up to No 1 and selected Goff over North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz He was to be the quarterback of the future but his debut quickly turned sour Now entering his second NFL season Goff has seen plenty of challenges In 2016 he failed to win a single game as a starter and the Rams finished the year 412 In his seven losses Goff threw for 1089 yards five touchdowns and seven interceptions Goff however said his first season was just minor growing pains I think it can be a bit overblown Goff said You see what Marcus Mariota has done coming from Oregon and even Derek Carr played somewhat of a spread at Fresno State I would love to fall in those footsteps with my career But you see it all the time nowadays guys making that transition Its been getting better and better After a week of being the Rams 2017 fulltime starter Goff seems to have turned the corner in his career Against the Indianapolis Colts he went 21of29 for 306 yards in a touchdown during Los Angeles 469 blowout win Granted Goff was not facing an elite defense and many of his receivers were wide open on deep routes However Goff looked poised in the pocket and knew where the smart throws were when given time to go through his progressions While the jury is still out on Goffs improvement many in the Redskins locker room said the young quarterbacks improvement has only been aided by the Rams hiring former Washington offensive coordinator Sean McVay as head coach McVay spent three years developing Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins into the starter he is today Well I think Sean has experience working with another young quarterback in myself Cousins said He knows what its like to try to teach his system to somebody whos new to the league and new to starting so this is not the first time around for Sean along those lines and Jared has all the talent in the world you know with the arm talent and that certainly gives them a great chance then because that doesnt limit what Sean can do from a play calling standpoint when Jared has that ability to throw it all over the field Redskins defensive players took note of Goffs development Safety DJ Swearinger said it will be up to the defense to try and confuse Goff with plenty of different looks If they can get him flustered he said then the turnovers will come He did some great stuff and Im looking forward to playing him on Sunday Swearinger said Weve got to disguise and get pressure on him make him uncomfortable and hell throw us the ball', 'As the Rams offense looks to build off last weeks performance against the Colts the Redskins understand that they need to bottle up Todd Gurley to have success Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley took the NFL by storm in 2015 At just 21 years of age the 10thoverall draft pick did not crack under the significant pressure surrounding his debut season He ran for 1106 yards He scored 10 touchdowns He won Offensive Rookie of the Year 2016 however was a much different story Hampered by a volatile quarterback situation and a shaky offensive line Gurley saw regressions in his rushing yards 885 touchdowns six and yards per carry 32 The low numbers across the board were a big surprise considering the promise he showed as one of the youngest players in the league just a year prior The only bright spot might have been the spike he saw in the passing game more than doubling his total receptions from the previous year 2017 is of course a new season and a chance for Gurley to have the bounce back year that many expect him to have in his third season The situation around the Georgia product seems to be better this year A more experienced Jared Goff is under center and Sammy Watkins is holding down the top receiver spot which should help take some attention away from Gurley Redskins head coach Jay Gruden spoke highly of the young running back and his tools not putting too much stock into his 2016 showing Hes a big threat He is still a good running back Gruden said this week He has great vision good sight lines He has got burst through the hole He is a good back Despite the praise Gurley has yet to truly get it going this season even after the Rams 469 thrashing of the Colts last week in Los Angeles He struggled for the most part in the running game rushing for just 40 yards on 19 attempts but did find the end zone once He was unable to get much of anything going on the ground but Goff completed five passes to Gurley for 56 yards The 23 year olds continued growth as a pass catcher is surely a positive sign but for a guy who averaged just 32 yards per carry last season the Rams organization would undoubtedly appreciate a more efficient performance on the ground On the whole it was a slightly underwhelming showing for Gurley but Gruden pointed out that he had a few runs that were called back due to penalty Despite the dip in his production in the past 12 months the running back continues to be a focal point of the Rams offense Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations Gruden said of the Rams offense A lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of

offense also made one of the flashier moves in the offseason adding formerly retired running back Marshawn Lynch to the roster Lynch an Oakland native is expected to say goodbye to football for good once the Raiders move to Las Vegas in 2020 Despite spending an entire season away from the game the 31yearold groundandpound rusher has not missed a step in his return gaining 76 yards in Week 1 and 45yards with a touchdown in Week 2 On the opposite side of the ball the Raiders addressed holes in the roster by drafting three defensive players in the first three rounds of the 2017 NFL Draft This came after the Oakland defense allowed 4120 yards through the air and 1881 yards on the ground in 2016 Cornerback Gareon Conley was selected in the first round and will look to take advantage of the still developing relationship between Cousins and receiver Terrell Pryor Sr At linebacker former Seattle Seahawk Bruce Irvin enters his second season clad in black and silver His debut season with Oakland saw him record 57 tackles and seven sacks Up front the Raiders have defensive end Khalil Mack to disrupt opponents passing game Mack came away with 77 tackles and 11 sacks in 2016', 'On a day in which the passing game was subdued Redskins running back Chris Thompson took over in the second quarter with two big touchdown runs It was a play the Washington Redskins took out of the Pittsburgh Steelers playbook Just a few minutes after Redskins running back Chris Thompson took a toss play in for Washingtons first touchdown in a 2720 victory over the Los Angeles Rams the Florida State product had the highlight play of the day On 2 nd and6 with less than two minutes left in the first half and Washington up 1310 quarterback Kirk Cousins delayed his handoff to Thompson before the shifty running back burst past an overly aggressive Rams defensive line Bursting past multiple Rams in the backfield Thompson aided by strong blocks from both guard Brandon Scherff and tight end Jordan Reed cut into the middle of the field before outracing the entire defense for a 61yard touchdown We actually took it from the Steelers Thompson said of his touchdown run Weve seen LeVeon Bell he does it a lot Its one of those plays where he has the option to run through a lot of different gaps and we thought we could possible get that going this week The Oline they did a great job and its all credit to them because they did such a good job at blocking I just had to use my speed and get the job done It looked as if Thompson wouldnt quite finish the run for a score as his college teammate Rams safety Lemarcus Joyner caught up with the Washington running back just at the goal line But Thompson evaded his tackle attempt to complete the longest running play of his fouryear career Down at the end Lamarcus Joyner almost caught me and it just reminded me of a situation we had during camp back in college Thompson said I broke a long run and he caught me right at the 1yard line He hit me right at the 1yard line in practice so I saw him after the game and was like Man you cant do that to me again It was just a good play a good job by the offensive line good play by Coach Jay Gruden also Thompson finished the day with 77 yards on three carries two of which ended in scores It was part of a big day for the ground game as Thompson Rob Kelley and Samaje Perine combined for 229 rushing yards It helped balanced out an offensive attack on a day when Cousins threw for just 179 yards That time of possession keeping the possession of the ball being able to run the ball control the clock was big Thompson said We werent real successful with that last week and we were able to get the job done this week and our offensive line they just continued to fight The Rams they have a great frontseven so its all credit to our Oline They just continue to just fight and battle it out Washington of course was able to hold off multiple comeback attempts from Los Angeles after jumping out to an early lead Despite a sluggish third quarter from the offense and the Rams continue to fight back Thompson was happy with how the Redskins remained resilient in the face of adversity These situations it just shows how we continue to fight together how close we are as a team Thompson said In that third quarter our offense we couldnt get anything going and our defense continued to fight They continued to help us stay in the game and they got us the ball back later in the game and we just made some plays I love this group Theres just something different with this group of guys that we have this year Were a lot closer everybodys like brothers out there You want to do things to not let your brothers down We made the necessary plays today', 'The Redskins got clutch plays on both sides of the ball from Ryan Grant and Mason Foster to close out the teams first victory of the season With a tie game and time winding down the Redskins knew they would need big efforts both on offense and defense to secure their first victory of the season In a matter of two plays from scrimmage they got exactly that taking the lead and preserving it with quick heroics to beat the Rams 2720 in Los Angeles The common theme between both plays a touchdown pass hauled in by wide receiver Ryan Grant and an interception snagged by linebacker Mason Foster required trust and patience a reliance on those around them and their own abilities It began with offense and after nine plays taking up more than five minutes thanks to a steady rungame which remained healthy throughout the entire day quarterback Kirk Cousins faced third down and the looming possibility that the Redskins might have to settle for a field goal with less than two minutes remaining Instead of running and forcing the Rams to burn their final timeout head coach Jay Gruden opted for a pass play Cousins dropped back bought time then rolled to his left waiting for Grant to gain space in the corner of the end zone where he dropped a pass into his hands with enough room for Grant to tap his toes and score six points The 11yard pass capped a 10play drive that ran five minutes and 27 seconds off the clock Its not about me man its about Jay Gruden the offensive lineman and Kirk Cousins being able to let the play develop and get me the ball Grant said modestly There was a defensive end aligned on top of me so I had to wait to see what he was going to do to make my move After a kick return to the Rams 19yard line Los Angeles tried to put together a final drive to tie the game Wide receiver Cooper Kupp lined up in the slot which Foster recognized might indicate a similar play run from earlier in the game He was alerted and affirmed by his defensive backs and decided to jump the short out route he presumed would be called It was and without quarterback Jared Goff accounting for Foster the linebacker outstretched his hands and collected his first interception running towards the end zone before eventually falling down to seal the victory They had widened the stack out a little bit so I felt like earlier in the game I barely missed one and I told Kendall Fuller and Zach Brown next time we see it Im just going to go play it Im going to go jump it Foster said It just so happens that the time that we saw it again was when we needed it the most But it was something that the coaches had alerted all week something that everybody talked about I just happened to be the one to make the play So its a great team win To add to the heroics Foster had come out of the game earlier in the second half with a shoulder injury and he said after the game it needed to be popped back in and bandaged up underneath his chest protector It was one of many injuries the Redskins battled through It is something that we had harped on all week Foster said of the resiliency of the team Just keep playing through everything and play together Dont get down things are going to happen theyre a good team everybodys good in the NFL but just keep playing together and well find a way to get it done and I feel like thats exactly what we did today For a team that struggled to execute when it counted against the Eagles last week both sides of the ball found ways to correct some of those mistakes and come through when it mattered most Foster and Grants plays epitomized that focus and the Redskins left Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with a victory and more importantly the confidence in knowing they are capable of finishing out games the way they want I mean it definitely feels great Foster said I felt like I had to redeem myself for some of the plays last week I felt like I could have been better on So everybody messes up everybody makes mistakes but if you play together as a team and keep grinding youll find a way to get a win and I think thats what we did today', 'A list of stats and notes from the Washington Redskins Week 2 matchup with the Los Angeles Rams that took place at the Los Angeles

a couple feet to spare for the goahead touchdown It was like a bunch formation going on and I had a defensive end over me so I was going to wait to see what he was going to do to get onto my route Grant said It felt good man everyones happy and our goal was to come in here and get the win and thats what we did Knotted at 2020 and starting from their own 30yard line running back Samaje Perine was called upon to carry the load which he did substantially in the second half after running back Rob Kelley was removed from the game due to injury He started off with a twoyard gain and after an

valuable clock time Cousins then found Terrelle Pryor Sr near the sideline and the wide receiver turned inward and sprinted up the field for a 23yard gain Perine took two more handoffs for six yards

in which the Redskins struggled to run the ball Washington breaks out with more than 200 yards on the ground In Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Redskins running backs accounted for just 34 rushing yards It was a different story on Sunday against a vaunted Los Angeles defense as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for 229 rushing yards All three running backs collected at least 65 yards on the ground marking the first time that has happened for the Redskins since the 1957 I think we just came out with the mindset we were going to run the ball enough so we did said Kelley who finished with 78 rushing yards on just 12 carries before being removed from the game with a rib injury I think we also run the ball I think he first couple plays we showed up and we were actually running it so coach stuck with it In the second quarter Thompson broke the game open with two touchdown runs On the first play of the quarter Thompson benefitted from setup blocks from Trent Williams and Terrelle Pryor Sr to take a pitch seven yards to the house Then just a few minutes later the shifty running back showed off his moves weaving in and out of the Rams defense for a 61yard score Thompson said the play was something the Redskins saw the Steelers use Weve seen LeVeon Bell he does it a lot Thompson said Its one of those plays where he has the option to run through a lot of different gaps and we thought we could possible get that going this week The Oline they did a great job and its all credit to them because they did such a good job at blocking Perine finished off the strong ground game performance on Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive as the rookie collected 38 rushing yards before Kirk Cousins found Ryan Grant for an 11yard touchdown I like the way he ran said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a tough physical guy like we thought 2 Ryan Grant comes through with the biggest moment of his career to date Opportunities Thats been the buzzword with the Redskins coaching staff when it comes to the fourthyear veteran In his first three seasons in Washington Grant was hidden on the depth chart behind the likes of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon But with the two veterans off the roster Grant has finally been given the opportunity to produce While the Tulane product was quiet for most of the day he hauled in the gamewinning score with less than two minutes left On 3 rd and5 from the 11yard line Grant lined up in a bunch formation on Cousins left After a slight delay off the line Grant ran out to his left before Cousins found him on the side of the end zone for a score It felt good man Grant said Everyones happy and our goal was to come in here and get the win and thats what we did As Washington seeks to get the passing game back on track after two quiet performances to start the season Cousins hopes to get Grant involved more He continues to show up on our practice film being wide open running really good routes Cousins said Ill work a go ball on the left and I can pick either side and Ryan is running by his defender on the other side It was great to get him a touchdown today Weve got to continue to get him involved and get him opportunities because hell prove his strength 3 A dislocated shoulder didnt stop Mason Foster from slamming the door shut on the Rams Even though Grants touchdown put the Redskins ahead with less than two minutes left Los Angeles still had time to piece together a potential gametying touchdown drive But Foster who had suffered a dislocated shoulder in the third quarter jumped a route intended for Cooper Kupp on Los Angeles first offensive play following the touchdown They had widened the stack out a little bit so I felt like earlier in the game I barely missed one and I told Kendall Fuller and Zach Brown next time we see it Im just going to go play it Im going to go jump it and it just so happens that the time that we saw it again was when we needed it the most Foster said But it was something that the coaches had alerted all week something that everybody talked about I just happened to be the one to make the play So its a great team win Foster has been impressive in the role of starting Mike linebacker for the Redskins this season Along with his gamesealing interception Foster also had six tackles and a pass defensed But the pick his first in three seasons with the Redskins capped off Washingtons lategame heroics I think he was waiting on that play the whole day said DJ Swearinger The linebackers were waiting on it the safeties the corners and we finally got it at the end of the game and he did what he was supposed to do to it Thats a great play by him and a great team win 4 The Redskins showed resiliency in the face of adversity Early on it looked as if the Redskins were going to easily handle the Rams Washington jumped out to a 100 lead and were primed to extend that lead to 170 after a Todd Gurley fumble But a drive that started at the Los Angeles 30yard stalled out with two incompletions on fade routes Still Dustin Hopkins was able to extend the lead to 130 But the Rams would fight back and score 10 unanswered points in the second half to knot the game at 20 apiece Between the gamewinning touchdown drive and Fosters interception though the Redskins did not break I think the guys just coming out here and battling four quarters and not threeandahalf said Josh Norman We did our job today and we executed Offensive line youve got to tip your hats off to those guys they are awesome There were role models today they did everything Give our running backs the rock they plow away and thats what you need from an offense like that Thompson was also pleased with how the Redskins fought back especially after a third quarter in which the offense was shut down In that third quarter our offense we couldnt get anything going and our defense continued to fight Thompson said They continued to help us stay in the game and they got us the ball back later in the game and we just made some plays I love this group Theres just something different with this group of guys that we have this year Were a lot closer everybodys like brothers out there You want to do things to not let your brothers down We made the necessary plays 5 As the offense still tries to seek an identity Cousins thinks the passing game will improve as time goes on Last season of course the Redskins were one of the best passing teams in the NFL Cousins nearly passed for 5000 yards while three different receivers posted at least 800 yards Through two games this year though the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific Through Sundays action Cousins ranks 16 th in passing yards 419 with just two touchdown passes In Sundays victory Cousins passes for just 179 yards with the late touchdown throw to Grant It was productive enough to get past the Rams but Cousins remains high on the potential of the passing attacks abilities I think were optimistic that right away we were going to be able to operate out of the gate Cousins said But when youre going against your own defense day after day after day it doesnt necessarily give you a great picture of what the real thing is going to look like against different teams every single week Were going to figure out an identity as we go and see what we do well Weve got to figure it out the sooner the better', 'STATEMENT FROM THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS Today the Redskins have officially placed Sua Cravens on the ReserveLeft Squad list In accordance with the NFL Constitution and Bylaws Sua

amplified when I got to college and after that I bled burgundy and gold Hart said We never really had money to go to a game so I was always able to watch it but once I got to Philly and they had all the Eagles games everything was Fly Eagles Fly and Im like Yo I just started really loving the Redskins I couldnt just turn the TV on to turn to whatever station and the Skins were on so I ended up

a quieter neighbor to Washington DC that he said fit his personality Im not really much of a loud erratic guy he said In that sense it has been an adjustment since moving to Los Angeles The vibe is different and all that so its just weird because there was a couple times where I would be out be in different areas and wow its just a culture shock and its way different from being in Maryland or even Philly I can see why people can get caught up in this scene and everything in LA As the season gets going Hart is intent on finding a Redskins lounge or bar to watch games in LA when he can on Sundays before the season gets too hectic He already has a Kirk Cousins and Taylor jersey and has a Norman one ordered thats on its way I loved Sean Taylor I loved Clinton Portis loved Santana Moss

2 often comes expected improvements Play calling becomes smoother players look more at ease in their systems and fewer mistakes are made Of all of Washingtons Week 2 improvements none stand out more than the running game Against the Philadelphia Eagles the Redskins gained 64 yards from the combined efforts of running backs Chris Thompson and Rob Kelly along with quarterback Kirk Cousins In Sundays matchup against the Los Angeles Rams Washington rushed for 229 yards The difference According to Kelley no drastic changes were implemented to improve the ground attack It all came down to determination Honestly we havent done anything we havent been doing he said I think we just came out with the mindset we were going to run the ball enough so we did I think we also run the ball I think the first couple plays we showed up and we were actually running it so Coach Jay Gruden stuck with it Nearly half of the offensive plays during the Redskins first drive were runs That drive ended with a field goal and moments later Washingtons defense forced the Rams to punt Then head coach Jay Gruden dialed up the ground game calling six straight runs that ended in a Kelley touchdown We tried it and thats what we thought we had most success at is running the football Gruden said From counters or powers we have a lot of different schemes going at them gaps traps wraps all that stuff pitches guys pulling We have an athletic line a powerful line and it was great to show their versatility today Unfortunately for the offense Kelley missed a large portion of the game after going down with an injury Undeterred Gruden relied on the efforts of Chris Thompson and rookie running back Samaje Perine to carry the load Thompson who recently signed an extension with the team proved his worth near the end of the second quarter After taking the handoff in a draw play Thompson cut from the designed running lane into the wideopen middle of the field Sixtyone yards later Washington had its second touchdown of the game They made me look good Thompson said On that draw play it was a look that we never really went over and they just got the job done and I was just able to do my thing and run So lets all give credit to the Oline and guys that were blocking for me The physical style of Washingtons offense came with an added benefit The defense which spent more time on the field than the offense in Week 1 was given plenty of time on the sideline to rest The Redskins held onto the ball for over 36 minutes compared the Rams having possession for 23 minutes Were on the sideline chilling said safety DJ Swearinger I caught myself a couple times getting up and stretching because they had the ball so long I tip my hat to the offensive line those guys did a great job Keep it

or coaches Lanier said I didnt grow up with a father in the household so my coaches were my father figures in my life Jarrett who suffered a severe injury during his rookie season talked about how his

passes for less than 200 yards in Washingtons victory but the Pro Bowler was effective in marching the offense to a gamewinning touchdown For much of the first threeandahalf quarters of Sundays victory over the Rams Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins never seemed to completely settle in against a tough Los Angeles defense He had trouble getting insync with his receivers at times while the offense was mainly powered by the running game When it mattered most however Cousins delivered With 716 left in the fourth quarter the Redskins got the ball back after a gametying field goal from the Rams Greg Zuerlein that knotted the game at 20 With the help of an impressive showing from rookie running back Samaje Perine Cousins orchestrated a 10play 70yard drive that lasted more than five minutes that put the Redskins in front by a touchdown The drive was capped off by an 11yard touchdown strike to wide receiver Ryan Grant on a key third down play Good play call by Jay Gruden the coverage took me to Ryan Grant based on the presnap and postsnap alignments Cousins said after the game Ryan did a great job creating separation slipping through there kept two feet in bounds and made a great play That one felt really good The touchdown pass to Grant was the cherry on top of what was a flawless drive for Cousins He completed all three of his passes for 42 yards including a clutch third down completion to Jamison Crowder and a 23yard catchandrun by Terrelle Pryor Huge throw at the end of the game Gruden said Kirk managed the game managed the clock Got us in the right runs and pretty good job overall Prior to the gamewinning drive Cousins had completed 15 of his 24 passes for just 137 yards and no scores Despite the pedestrian showing in the first three quarters Cousins resiliency helped him seal the deal on the Redskins first win of the year In this league its always going to be up and down and when you run the ball as well as we do it creates a different type of game he said So glad we won Found a way to be resilient make plays and showed a lot of character Like he did on the goahead touchdown drive Cousins benefitted from a great performance from the running game all day The running back trio of Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Perine combined for 229 yards two touchdowns and a 62 yards per carry average On the Redskins first touchdown drive of the game Cousins wisely stepped back and let the running game take the reigns The one drive we scored on I believe we didnt even throw a pass if I remember right I dont know how many times that happens during a season to have an entire drive running the ball That was unique Cousins said The drive lasted six plays and traveled 65 yards all via the running game It may not have been a standout game on the stat sheet from Cousins but he knew to feed the ground game when it was rolling and delivered a touchdown drive when it mattered most Why would you abandon the run game if its going so well Cousins asked Just keep doing it until they can prove they can stop it', 'Check out the top images from the Washington Redskins 2017 Week 2 game against the Los Angeles Rams that took placed at the Los

weeks of near full health the Washington Redskins head into their Week 3 Sunday night matchup with the Oakland Raiders with numerous players on both sides of the football dealing with injury In his Monday conference call with local media Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said that running back Rob Kelley ribs tight end Jordan Reed cheststernum contusion cornerback Josh Norman AC joint sprain safety Montae Nicholson AC joint sprain linebacker Mason Foster shoulder dislocationlabrum safety Deshazor Everett knee sprainMCL and tackle Morgan Moses ankle sprainshoulder strain are all currently daytoday Despite the injuries all seven players are dealing with right now it appears that Washington avoided major injuries in a 2720 Week 2 victory over the Los Angeles Rams at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum The Redskins had yesterday and today off from practice as the players were able to receive extended treatment Well put the pads on and practice Wednesday and see how many guys can participate and go from there Gruden said But you know obviously Rob Kelleys a tough guy I think hell try to play with that thing but you never know how much pain hes in Well see how that rib feels Same with Jordan same with Josh same with Montae same with Mason same with Deshazor same with Morgan So theyre all a concern but theyre all tough guys and hopefully well have them Kelley was experiencing a breakout game against the Rams before being removed from the game as the secondyear Tulane product had 78 rushing yards on just 12 carries Setting the tone on the first drive of the game with six carries for 22 yards Kelley also ripped off backtoback runs of 19 and 21 yards on Washingtons second drive of the game Even with Kelleys injury the Redskins were still able to rip through the Rams defense on the ground In total Kelley Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson combined for 222 yards It also marked the first time the Redskins had three different players reach 65 rushing yards in a single game for the first time since Dec 1 1957 according to the Elias Sports Bureau I think that Samaje did a good job of stepping in and putting us in good situations Kelley said Thats all you can ask out of him back like that to be put in us in situations I think Chris did an excellent job for capitalizing on the opportunities If Kelley cant play this weekend the Redskins will look to Mack Brown as another running back they can rely on Brown hasnt been active yet this season but the secondyear Florida product produced last season when his number was called against the Chicago Bears Reed meanwhile was briefly removed from the game in the third quarter before returning in the final frame He finished with team highs in receptions six and receiving yards 48 on a day in which the passing game struggled at times to be effective Defensively Fosters shoulder dislocation wasnt enough to slow him from making the gamesealing interception off Jared Goff with less than two minutes left in Sundays matchup with the Rams Very tough individual Gruden said of Foster Hes played multilinebacker both linebacker positions been very successful Hes a great leader for us Does anything he wants special teams and its great when you have a highcharacter guy like that have some production so people can start to realize what a great player he is not just a great guy As for Nicholson the 2017 fourthround pick made his first career start in only his second professional game appearing on 26 on the defenses 50 snaps Although Nicholson was sidelined for all of offseason workouts and limited for a majority of training camp hes quickly impressed the coaching staff We started him in training camp obviously he wasnt on PUP but he was unable to practice but he was getting all the walkthrough reps so he was getting all the mental reps which is important for him Gruden said Then when he was able to practice he just got in there and made some plays He is a big physical guy that can run and we are excited about his prospects Nothing against Everett we are just trying to get him out there and get him some reps We know how important that position is The last couple years we have had a lot of injuries so we are trying to get all our guys ready to play Montae has all the traits to be a great safety we just have got to get him in there and get him some experience and the more experience he gets the better he will get', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Wednesday September 20 2017 All reports rumors and

Banner his son Darren Banner and his son Xavier Dameron have made watching the Redskins a family tradition which started with Jerrys own father I learned about the Redskins through my dad Jerry said I go back through the era of Sammy Baugh Charlie Justice those were some dismal years but we stuck with them As a family passes down its devotion from one member to the next it is understandable that there will periods of time that test fandom For Jerry it has also provided important lessons about sticking with your favorite team I developed a fondness for the team and also understood loyalty amongst family members Darren said Its almost like a life lesson You dont give up on a person or your team if theyre going through a bad time You encourage them uplift them support them so that everybody can celebrate the victory once we finally get to where we need to be Darren expressed that his favorite player in Redskins history remains Sean Taylor whom he considers the best player on the roster ever As for Xavier he prefers a current defender I like Bashaud Breeland I like his attitude Xavier said I first noticed him in 2014 against the Cowboys in Dallas he shut down Dez Bryant

about the Redskins roster and more as the team prepares for a Week 3 matchup with the Raiders at FedExField NPHarris 4 asks What is the defensive plan for stopping Oaklands running game HailMail Once again the Redskins will face another one of the leagues toughest running backs in the form of fivetime Pro Bowler Marshawn Lynch Despite spending the 2016 season in retirement Lynch appears to have not missed a beat so far in his first year with Oakland In two games so far this year Lynch has carried the ball 30 times for 121 yards and one touchdown In a blowout victory over the New York Jets last Sunday Lynchs workload was light He carried the ball only 12 times on just 23 offensive plays After struggling to slow down opposing running games last year Washington has shown growth in that category this season Yes Todd Gurley was able to rush for 88 yards last week but Washington is currently ninth against the run so far this year allowing just 75 rushing yards per contest One key to the teams early success stopping the run has been their ability to wreak havoc without giving up big plays The Redskins are one of just two teams in the NFL right now to have forced three fumbles without giving up a 20yard run The goal this week will be to remain aggressive against Beast Mode and an Oakland rushing attack that also includes Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington We might give up a run here and there but at the end of the day were going to come after you were going to tackle you said Redskins linebacker Zach Brown It doesnt matter who you are because some of us have already played against Marshawn when he was with the Seahawks So for us it was the same guy that was at the Seahawks but you know hes just got a better Oline So when we hit him we just have to make sure we keep driving our feet John G asks Hopkins has now missed 2 field goals in two games Should we be worried HailMail Yes Hopkins missed a 51yard field goal attempt in last Sundays victory over the Los Angeles Rams when he had enough power to hit the lengthy attempt but clanked it off one of the uprights but the 26yearold remains one of the best players at his position today It is one of the main reasons why Washington didnt bring in any kicking competition for Hopkins during the offseason I think hes a young kid and I think hes worth having here said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden last month I dont think we really need to bring in a lot of competition but we have a list of players to bring in if they struggle just like everybody else at every other position But I have total confidence that the specialists wont struggle and theyre going to be a great weapon for us Hop can bang it Between Washingtons four preseason and two regular season games this year Hopkins is 10of12 on his field goal attempts and a perfect 10of10 on extra point tries He has also had six of his kickoffs downed for touchdowns tied for the 11 th best mark through two weeks Field goals of 50plus yards are far from automatic as last Sunday proved for Hopkins But he has shown the past that he can kicks from that distance While Hopkins started strong before dealing with some inconsistencies midway through last season the Redskins remain high on the fourthyear Florida State product DorianB asks How much Samaje should we expect with Kelley being Day to day This will be something that well have to monitor as the week progresses Kelley as you mentioned is currently daytoday as he deals with a rib injury suffered in the second quarter of Washingtons victory over the Rams Hell have three days of practices to test the injury but if he cant play on Sunday the team will likely look to rookie Samaje Perine as the featured back with Chris Thompson and Mack Brown serving their own roles After not playing offensive snaps in Washingtons regular season opener against the Eagles Perine appeared on 26 plays against Los Angeles defense The Oklahoma product got off to a bit of a slow start as he had just 12 yards on his first five carries But as the game wore on Perine started to get into a groove On Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive late in the fourth quarter the 5foot11 236 pounder carried the ball seven times for 38 yards I think I felt him run with a lot of power Gruden said Even after his 10 th 12 th 15 th carry I still think he had power left in the tank which was good to see A lot of times you dont know how their stamina is going to be when they get more than 1012 carries but I think his stamina was outstanding and he ran with great pad level and got the tough physical yards we needed Some have wondered if it should be Thompson as the feature back if Kelley is sidelined especially with his redhot start to this season But Gruden doesnt want to expand Thompsons role too much Chris has got such a defined role for this offense and it could be expanded but hes so important to us on third down we just have to be careful Gruden said Hes not the biggest guy in the world We dont want him to get 2025 carries a game and get a lot of pounding on that body Hes definitely needed in pass protection and the routes and all that stuff on third down and red zone So well try to expand his role a little bit but we dont want to go too crazy with him', 'According to Gerald McCoy credit is due to the big guys around the league The eightyear defensive tackle recently took to The Players

blog comparing himself to Batman an ordinary guy doing extraordinary things but then quickly jumps into those hardhitters he remembers most First on his list Washington Redskins offensive tackle Trent Williams I dont even think hes human McCoy writes He must be some kind of mutant or something Hes got a big wide body really long arms and big strong hands When youre going up against him if he gets his hands on you youre in trouble man Williams and McCoy both attended Oklahoma and first met on the Sooners practice field McCoy recounts one of their first interactions when Williams challenged him to a sprint race So all the linemen get on the line and raceand Trent beats everybody McCoy said Leaves most guys in the dust McCoy said he was blown away by how fast Williams was at such a heavy weight According to him Williams came in to Oklahoma at 330 pounds He said theres no doubt Williams is faster after losing weight when he started training in the NFL McCoy described Williams blocking style as unique Instead of coming hot off the line and hitting hard on first contact he uses his basketball skills to mirror the movements of the defense He wont mow people over on the line he just keeps them out of the way McCoy said that all changes once Williams gets into the open field When Williams blocks on plays like screens he said thats when players should look out Man I feel bad for some of them dudes in the secondary when they see Trent coming McCoy said Hes a freight train The Buccaneers and Redskins have only faced each other three times since Williams and McCoy were drafted in 2010 McCoy said in each of those contests he never saw much of Williams which was alright by him Ive only really gone against him on double teams or when he comes out on a scoop block or something McCoy said Which is cool with me because I dealt with him enough at OU Now I try to avoid him at all costs McCoy also named Dallass Zac Martin Baltimores Marshal Yanda Oaklands Kelechi Osemele and retired players Davin Joseph and Carl Nicks as the toughest offensive linemen hes ever faced', 'Washington Redskins head coach Jay Gruden is eager to see what 21yearold safety Montae Nicholson can achieve with more playing time this year With the Washington Redskins seeking better play from the secondary particularly out of the safety position this season the team had a series of offseason moves including the signing of veteran DJ Swearinger While Swearinger has certainly made noise both on the field and off it quietly theres another new face that could make an impact rookie fourthround pick Montae Nicholson His skillset and play were somewhat overshadowed in a BIG 10 that conference that includes powerhouses Ohio State and instate rival Michigan However the Redskins liked what they saw out of the former track star In 2015 he helped Michigan State reach the college football playoffs by leading the team with three picks and 83 stops At the same time he participated on the track squad placing sixth in the Big Ten Indoor meet in the long jump Though he had only a total of four interceptions in his collegiate career his speed and physical size can become strong attributes for him in his NFL career The Redskins drafted him more as a prospect that further requires grooming and development They wanted to have him gain some experience under the wings of Swearinger and even DeAngelo Hall However Nicholson has already risen through the ranks for the Redskins In just his second regular season game the 21yearold received a start alongside Swearinger Nicholson played 26 snaps and recorded two tackles He wasnt perfect as he still needs to show he can cover oneonone against tight ends I think he has just progressed said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden We started him in training campobviously he wasnt on PUP but he was unable to practice but he was getting all the walkthrough reps so he was getting all the mental reps which is important for him The coaching staff has high hopes about what Nicholson can accomplish even during his rookie season Depending on how much Nicholson who is dealing with an AC join sprain plays this week hell get another big test against an Oakland Raiders team that has won 14 of its last 18 regular season games He is a big physical guy that can run and we are excited to get him out there and get him some reps Gruden said We know how important the position is And as for how much he plays thatll depend on how the defensive coaching staff wants to rotate him in with Deshazor Everett Both have their strengths but the sky could be the limit for Nicholson Theyre different players really Gruden said I think Montae covers a lot of ground Hes very long and very fast and Montae is a good hitter too', 'Check out these photos of the

in Redskins history presented by Maryland Lottery My Lottery Rewards Redskinscom takes a look back at one of Washingtons best wins from the 1991 season The Redskins put on quite a performance for the home crowd against the Phoenix Cardinals Washington put points on the board in every quarter of the game while the Cardinals walked away from RFK Stadium scoreless The defense led the effort for the Redskins both by keeping the Cardinals scoreless and putting points on the board in the third quarter A 55yard interception return for a touchdown by linebacker Wilber Marshall off quarterback Tom Tupa one of three interceptions he had in the game helped the cause Rushing touchdowns by running back Earnest Byner and wide receiver Ricky Sanders gave Washington the early 140 lead and a 28yard pass by quarterback Mark Rypien to wide receiver Gary Clark spread the margin out to 21 The pick six and two field goals by kicker Chip Lohmiller sealed the 340 victory for the Redskins in dominant fashion to continue Washingtons undefeated opening to the season 30', 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 He loves the versatility Chris Thompson brings Its no question the Redskins offense has benefited greatly from running back Chris Thompsons play through two games this season The thirddown back whose role may increase more depending on the health status of starter Rob Kelley has scored three of the teams four offensive touchdowns thus far increasing his playmaking while continuing to be a supreme passblocker The quickspark ability has made it easier on quarterback Kirk Cousins whose load has been lightened by Thompsons versatility The Florida State product has gained 81 yards both rushing and receiving providing a changeup from the more punishing running style of Kelley and Samaje Perine Cousins ran off a laundry list of the things Thompson does well He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Cousins said There is just a lot to like and the other thing about Chris that you have to know from his story is it wasnt like he showed up as a rookie and was an AllPro It took time to develop and thats the case with so many guys in this league He has got a great demeanor about him Cousins added He is very composed very intelligent good teammate I told him that I said Youre the kind of guy I want in the huddle in a tense moment in an away stadium just because you feel like he is a guy who has composure about him and the moment is not too big for him So cant say enough good things about Chris and hopefully continue to lean on him I think we will continue to lean on him because of the mismatches he can create on linebackers and things like that 2 Thompsons conscientious mentality is an example of the strong locker room the team has The Thompson love continued when Cousins was asked about how Thompson felt bad that he couldnt collect a pass in the Rams game that could have potentially gone for another long score Thompson lamented the fact that the catch would have likely given Cousins more than 200 yards passing It was another small example of a player thinking about his teammate Ive said it many times and hopefully it translates to wins I dont know that it always does but we do have a really good locker room Cousins said It is examples like that where players are thinking of other players that makes a big difference The second the ball left my hand and we didnt complete it I said to myself I threw it too hard I didnt give him a chance to really catch it I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward 3 With more reps hell have more opportunities to find Josh Doctson in the passing game A few times during Sundays game against the Rams wide receiver Josh Doctson slipped out of coverage and had an opportunity for a big pass play but Cousins didnt look his way That was due to a variety of things reading the defense differently having pressure in his face reasons why the two havent connected so far in the regular season That figures to change eventually and Doctsons full participation at practice Wednesday and presumably for the entire week should help get them on a better rapport come Sunday night against the Raiders Every play is different but you always have your reads and where your eyes are and you focus downfield and you try to feel the pass rush Cousins said There are times where you stand in there and make the throw which I have done many times There is times where you eat it and you take the sack to avoid a tipped ball or an interception or whatever it may be Theres times where you have enough time to throw the ball the way to avoid the sack but you also knew that the read downfield wasnt declaring and so rather than throwing it into a gray window you just throw the ball away Those are those splitsecond decisions that you try to train through muscle memory with a lot of practice reps and game reps Thats something that I think I am continuing to get better and better at 4 He respects Oaklands football culture and its premier defenders The first attribute that impressed Cousins about the teams next opponent the Raiders was their culture change over the last couple of years with quarterback Derek Carr under center Then he turned to their defense specifically defensive end Khalil Mack and linebacker Bruce Irvin who hes faced before when playing against Seattle Khalil Mack is as good as they come in the NFL and Bruce Irvin Ive played against when he was in Seattle and hes a very active player both in the pass game and in the run game Cousins said Very athletic in space Obviously we know David Amerson and the player that hes become Theyve got experienced players they had a great year and went to the playoffs last year for a reason and theyre 20 for a reason Very good defense Head coach Jay Gruden mentioned that Oakland mixes up its front seven really well making it challenging to know what kind of blitz packages are coming If the run game can sustain itself that should ease some of the pressure 5 Though the passing game hasnt quite clicked yet hes optimistic it will improve Cousins has thrown for just 419 yards in his first two regular season games putting him below pace from the past two years of prolific offense There are a variety of factors contributing to this slower start a dropped pass here a missed read there but Cousins remains confident that the pass offense will progress in the coming weeks especially if the run game can provide them more opportunities for playaction I would like to think that as the year goes on the offense gets better and better Cousins said Sometimes around this league I dont know I would be interested to do a study to see do offenses tend to take more time to get going than defenses in this league I wonder I know for me these last couple seasons weve gotten stronger as the year has gone on offensively and have gotten an identity and kind of gotten a better understanding of what we do well and how to make that work week in and week out Hopefully we take those steps going forward and we just hit our stride and play much better than we have the first two weeks But that being said we have still done some really good things the first two weeks and have moved the ball but I think there is more in the tank there that we have got to bring out', 'A morning

desire to stay in the DCarea and what he aspires to do after his football life finishes Is there a better feeling on the field than grabbing a picksix I would say a picksix in a win would be the only better feeling Two of my picksixes have come in losses the first one came in a win It was definitely a lot easier to enjoy after the win than it was after the losses Its definitely exciting because you catch the ball you kind of realize youre in the open by the crowds reaction because theyre cheering they know youre going to score At that point its just pure joy I can imagine when youre touching the football its a weird experience It is a little bit especially when youre running with it Its one thing to dive on it in a pile and just cover it but to catch it and run the other way and score with it its a little nervewracking because youre like hows my ball security going to be if I do encounter someone that wants to tackle me and how do I defeat someone if theyre going to try and tackle me Its definitely weird for a defender to do it but its a great feeling nonetheless Youre a mildmannered guy off the field and the opposite on the field Is it strange when you think about that dichotomy If you actually sit down and think about it yeah You think like Ok I have to be really aggressive violent and try to destroy the guy Im going against on the field but off the field Im pretty quiet pretty reserved nonconfrontational Its pretty interesting when you think about it I guess you have to have that to live a balanced life Oh you have to have that You dont want to be both on both fields You dont want to be nice off the field and nice on the field You dont want to be mean on the field and mean off the field You got to find the balance I know its clich to flip the switch Was passrusher a position you always wanted to play Yeah ever since I started playing tackle in fifth grade I was a defensive lineman partially because I was too heavy to carry the ball Otherwise I might have tried to play quarterback or something else Ive been playing defensive line and rushing the quarterback pretty much my whole football life Is there a big difference for you when you go through a variety of linebackers coaches as you have in your career A little bit Anytime you have a switch in coaches its obviously a change but I mean I think you just try to absorb as much as you can from each coach because theyre all going to help you take your game to another level Your birthday was last month How did you celebrate My fiance went down to the city and we went to Bens Chili Bowl Thats my first time going to the U Street original Thats kind of my thing Anytime I get a free chance I want to go to the city and just experience something new in the city because theres so much to do here in DC Thats kind of my thing Some guys go to the country I head east Did you at least have a nice dinner though We went to Eddie Vs in Tysons for dinner So I got one halfsmoke at Bens for the experience and then went to Eddie Vs afterwards Do you have any pressure around birthdays to make it a big day Honestly my birthdays always been during training camp so its never really been a big celebration thing to where Im like Im going to do this Im going to go out its always been whatever day of the week it is for me Since Ive been with my fiance birthdays have always been a big thing for her so shes always made my birthdays a big deal and always has balloons and cooks for me Its definitely changed since shes come into the picture So are you a little spoiled The past few Ive definitely been spoiled Is that the biggest difference being engaged now Yes Im definitely more spoiled on my birthdays now Its a point of emphasis for her and she takes pride in making it a good birthday You also help run your bulldogs Instagram account Did you realize this was going to be a thing I really had no idea Whats really funny is well be walking around Reston Town Center with the dogs and well get stopped by someone thatll say We follow your dogs on Instagram I cant believe its them Its like What These people are fans of my dogs Did you set up the Instagram first No my fiance did She set it up Ill throw up a post every once in a while but shes the wizard with it gets the pictures all right Its crazy to see the following Theyre awesome dogs Do you have more fun posting about dogs or posting on your own account The posts on my dogs account are more frequent so Id say on my account if Im posting about something Im really feeling Ok I want to get this out there because I want to make my posts unique and not so frequent Whats the main reason you dont tweet as much as some of your teammates I dont know I get on Twitter all the time Im probably on Twitter as much as anybody I just never post anything I just like to see what other people post Honestly I dont really have a lot to say both in person and on Twitter I guess you can leave the posting to your fiance Yeah shes a more frequent poster than I am She probably does a better job of keeping people up to date with what Im doing outside of football than I do Thats one of the perks of being engaged I ask because I know its easy to get jealous or annoyed with people who post a lot Is that maybe a reason for your smaller presence Yeah I see people who post all the time and there might not be a lot of difference in what they post one day to the next Oh hey Im working out today Next day Oh hey Im working out Its like alright we get it you like to work out I dont want anybody to ever feel like all he posts about is his dogs or football I want to keep a little variety and not oversaturate it Do you struggle with comparing yourself to other people On social media or on the football field No I wouldnt say that Where does the competitive edge come from Are you good at motivating yourself Yeah definitely because I feel like I have a lot of abilities and I have a lot of talent and a lot of good fortune in my life So I feel like I owe it to myself and everyone around me to work hard and be the best I can be Have you allowed yourself to think about the next step after football Yeah you try to think about what you want to do how you want to stay busy how you want to contribute to society and Ive got some ideas in mind and you always want to be prepared to make the right step now so when youre done you can make a smooth transition Ive got some things in mind Do you care to share any of them I know youve expressed interest in wanting to be on camera I would like that especially in Washington DC theres so much opportunity for that Obviously getting to stay in the area would be a dream come true for me so something footballrelated Ill have to do something footballrelated whether its coaching at one level or another high school college pro or doing something mediarelated I feel like it would have to be football or sportsrelated because Im too much of a sports guy to do something completely different Ive been told Big Ten network is a big love of yours I mean the BTN is you heard right Is that just the Purdue connection I guess I just associate the Big Ten network with falls in Big Ten country across the Midwest I had a lot of fond memories growing up in that time and playing college football in that area Thats probably where the fondness comes from Is it tough to stay present sometimes when you have ideas for the future and want to make connections throughout the year Id say its easy to stay present Its tough to think too far ahead in the future and try to do too much to prepare I still want to play football for a long time Thats my focus today and every day Whats something about Indiana most people dont know about I feel like in Indiana we have the hottest of the hot and the coldest of the cold weatherwise People always think that its this cold place but in the summertime it can get hot as hell there and its humid It can be in the high 90s low 100s but then in the winter it can be minus10 So its pretty unique in that theres so much variety And Indianapolis has those overhead walkways like Minneapolis because its so cold Right Another thing that weve got in Indiana is that people are so kind and friendly Midwest people are and I know the term salt of the earth get thrown around a lot but really its true Theyre good wholesome people and theyd give you the shirt off their back Do you think youd like to move back there or are you content to leave that as your childhood home I love it here now so if I could ultimately stay in the DC area that would be awesome Ive really grown to love the area Ill always love Indiana and everything about it But Im here now and hope to be for a long time Is there something in football that you feel is underreported Id say the daytoday making sure your body is ready to not only get ready for Sunday but get right for practice that day the amount of time you have to put in to get your body ready for practice and the different treatment youve got to do both here at the facility and then at home to make sure your body is ready for the game Because when we leave here we might be here for 1112 hours a day when we leave here the football doesnt really stop for a lot of us We go home and we watch film and we have to ice down what may be bothering us and do some stretching and whatnot Long story short all the extra stuff youve got to do Its not just practicing its not just watching film Its stretching after practice its foamrolling its watching film on your own making sure youre eating the right foods all the little things that are personal decisions that arent necessarily required by the coaching staff that really give a lot of guys an edge And thats something you take a lot of pride in Definitely Its not only something that helps me for each Sunday but it helps your body to feel better in general so that you can prolong your football career Speaking of which whats the shake youve been drinking as weve talked VegaOne Its a veganprotein plantbased protein Is this new This is new I did some bloodwork and found I had a wheyprotein intolerance so I started doing the plantbased So far so good So far so good It doesnt taste as good as whey but its a lot better for you so Ill take that Youre a fan favorite here Whats the strangest thing someones sent to you unsolicited Ive been invited to a number of peoples weddings The thing about that thats crazy to me is like it will be a really nice invitation so you can tell this is not just a wedding theyre throwing together in someones backyard This is like a really nice event Theyre inviting me and I dont know who they are But you have a place at their table To me thats like these people must really think a lot of me to invite me to their wedding If you have a free weekend and you had an invitation would you ever go to one You know what I want to I do want to one of these days because it would obviously mean something to them if theyre willing to invite me and if I were to show up Im sure it would mean something to them Maybe one day Ill do that Hopefully they can give me a plusone so my fiance can come I would think its risky because you might take all the attention away from the bride and groom Thats true You wouldnt want that And that would just be bad in general because Im not like the life of the party guy If Im the life of your party your party probably sucks Maybe you could just have a pen at the ready for autographs on the wedding line Yeah get out there for Shout and call it a day', 'Washingtons thirddown running back has dealt with a turbulent NFL career while overcoming his own self doubts Now he is thriving in his fourth year with the Redskins In the NFL change is inevitable Most of the time change comes at the benefit of player whether it be to maximize a certain skill or fill a need for the team Chris Thompson faced his fair share of change after leaving Florida State for the NFL Draft When he wasnt battling injuries while playing for the Seminoles Thompson was out on the field as much as possible However two seasonending injuries in his junior and senior years hurt his draft stock Once the Washington Redskins selected Thompson in the fifth round in 2013 it was clear his role in the game would soon change I think for me it was more mental than anything I had to learn over time It wasnt easy Thompson said Its something that I have to get used to but over time I started to get more and more comfortable Once I got comfortable with myself being in that role then I was able to execute better Thompsons new role includes being a primarily thirddown back in charge of giving the offense the extra push when it matters most along with returning kicks This new position came after years of being jostled around the roster going back and forth to the practice squad before finally signing an extension with the team in early September In Week 1 Thompson scored Washingtons only offensive touchdown of the game off a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins In Week 2 Thompsons role became paramount when fellow running back Rob Kelley went down with an injury during the third quarter While rookie Samaje Perine took most of the handoffs it was Thompson who put up the big numbers On just three carries he scored two touchdowns and amassed 77 yards He also made contributions in the passing game with three catches for 29 yards Chris is one of our best players and is a tremendous asset to our offense because he is so versatile Cousins said He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Thompsons day was not completely highlight filled however Some costly and avoidable mistakes kept him from turning in an almost spotless game Thompson failed to haul in what would have been a 60yard touchdown pass from Cousins early in the second half Im not going to lie to you on the plane ride getting dressed after the game this morning watching film when I was outside at practice I was thinking about that one play Thompson said My first thing I wanted to do when I got out there in individuals with the quarterbacks was to run that route again and catch the ball Thompson said one of the reasons he was bitter was that it kept Cousins from breaking 200 yards passing He said with that one catch he could have silenced those who question how balanced the Redskins offense is Cousins meanwhile said when a play falls through its never just one players fault I didnt give him a chance to really catch it Cousins said I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward Thompson said he often thinks this way after a costly mistake in a game He said it can be both a blessing and a curse always evaluating his game and trying to improve but sometimes spends too much time dwelling on his failures Yeah and people say that Im too hard on myself but thats just me Thats who I am Theres a lot of things I can go and look back on Thompson said Its something that as a human you have to let it go you have to move on but for me that motivates me to be better on the next

Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2012 When the Raiders drafted Charles Woodson if you didnt have a Charles Woodson jersey you werent cool on Seaside Foster said of his childhood We all pretty much grew up Raiders or Niners fans and my dad was a Raiders fan so I was a Raiders fan Fosters most impressionable memories of rooting on the black and silver were heartbreakers watching the Tuck Rule game in 2001 when the Raiders lost to the Patriots in the playoffs and then the following year watching Jon Gruden take down the Raiders who were then led by current Redskins offensive line coach Bill Callahan I didnt really talk to Callahan about that but it broke my heart as a little kid I couldnt believe it Foster said But its all good you know what I mean The Raiders have always been the hometown team but now like I said its all about the Redskins now On Wednesday Foster praised the training staff for their efforts in Sundays game against the Rams for getting him back on the field and for developing a plan for this weeks recovery Just take it day by day Foster said Of course youre always going to be sore after a game but just keep getting treatment keep working and itll feel better As of right now just going in there getting my treatment doing whatever they tell me to do and keep getting ready Foster did explain that having his shoulder popped back in on the sideline wasnt as big of a deal as people might perceive disregarding his own pain tolerance relative to the regular fans Its kind of like whatever Foster said You just sit there and you could just move it around and it goes back in The doctor has to get in right then youre alright to go Its not like the movies or nothing I think people think its like the movies like Friday Night Lights Boom once it goes in its Alright cool Before that its just kind of like numb feels like you dont have an arm Im alright just take it day by day and get better Foster will certainly need his shoulder strong to take on the Raiders physical attack headed on the ground by running back Marshawn Lynch In two regular season games Oakland ranks fourth in yards per rush 52 and fifth in rushing yards per game 1445 while its offense as a whole ranks first in points per game 355 The Redskins biggest strength on defense however has been their ability to limit the opponents run game Foes are averaging just 75 yards rushing against Washington good for ninth best in the league Foster likes the teams physicality and effort and knows it must be on full display Sunday night Its always a challenge Foster said In this league guys are so big the Olinemen are huge the running backs are quick and strong so its always tough but I feel like with the guys that we have weve been able to play pretty physical in the run game knock guys back and make plays Thats pretty much what weve got to do just continue to make plays and execute this game plan', 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 6 game against the San Francisco 49ers that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 Despite dealing with a major case of the injury bug the defense held on when it counted most In a back and forth fourth quarter the 49ers go one finally chance at a comeback victory with 52 seconds left on the clock While Washingtons improved defense got the upper hand on San Franciscos offense early particularly when Brian Hoyer was in the game the unit was banged up Cornerback Bashaud Breeland knee and defensive lineman Jonathan Allen foot both suffered gameending injuries Cornerback Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett of course wasnt playing either while safety DJ Swearinger briefly exited the contest with a stinger Quickly the 49ers got things rolling against the hampered defensive unit In just four plays San Francisco got to Washingtons 40yard line off two big catches by former Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garon But the receivers aggressive nature would ultimately cost his team their first victory of the season Called for offensive pass interference San Francisco was pushed back to the 50yard line They would never get back into field goal range as cornerback Kendall Fuller iced the game with his second interception of the season on a fourth down throw from CJ Beathard We were just kind of playing the sticks trying to make sure they dont get a first down at the same time trying to protect the sidelines Fuller said Definitely a good play call for the coaches The cornerback added that although the 49ers got into field goal range down just two points the defense never get nervous and never lost confidence We knew it was going to be a dog fight and weve just got to keep on fighting Fuller said 2 Outside of an errant pass that was picked quarterback Kirk Cousins once again was effective for the Redskins For the third time in as many games the Redskins offense scored on the units opening drive After receiving the opening kickoff against the 49ers Cousins drove the offense 75 yards in eight plays capped by an 11yard score from wide receiver Josh Doctson It was the first of three touchdowns on the afternoon for Cousins who also connected with Samaje Perine for a score and scampered in for a sevenyard touchdown in the fourth quarter In total Cousins passes for I think we did a good job as an offense Cousins said I think we moved the football There were a lot of good decisions a lot of good plays made a lot of thirddown conversions in big moments a lot of crucial drives where we had to churn the clock and come away with points So I was proud of the way our offense played today It wasnt perfect there were a couple mistakes but all in all we did a lot of good things Cousins touchdown run early in the fourth quarter was actually the gamewinning score for the Redskins On the option run Cousins pulled the ball back from Perine before running to his right unevaded into the end zone Its always been there because you know I would credit going back to my rookie year with Robert Griffin III here we did it a lot Cousins said Its always going to be a part of our offense because it does give defenses something to think about Kyle Shanahan told me when he left he said Ive learned after working with Robert that this is a really valuable play no matter who the quarterback is and Ill always carry it with me So when Jay Gruden arrived we kept it and valued it and as I started playing it can still be a great play You just have to pick your spots be smart with it call it at the right times and read it correctly and then usually you can get some yards 3 The young players particularly in the secondary stepped up At one of the deepest position groups on the roster the Redskins needed all of their active defensive backs on Sunday Normally of course the Redskins have Norman and Breeland as the starting cornerbacks But Norman missed the entire game with a rib injury while Breeland briefly dealt with a hamstring issue before a knee injury suffered when 49ers tackle Joe Staley rolled up on him knocked the Clemson product out of the contest In their place Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau saw significant reps Even seventhround pick Joshua Holsey logged snaps on the final drive It was the first time he ever played on defense in his nascent NFL career No dropoffs we prepare Dunbar said of the young defensive backs Everybody prepares like starters Coach Greg Manusky helping us through the week helping us during the week to prepare everybody like starters so that when you get in they expect you to play like a starter Swearinger told the defensive backs that theyre only as good as their weakest link In his eyes though the unit has no weak lines The next player up if the next player prepares hes going to be good Swearinger said Perfect preparation prevents poor performance and I tell the guys that all the time and we performed well 4 Chris Thompson and Vernon Davis continue to be the goto targets in the passing game but others had their contributions too On an afternoon in which Cousins completed 25 passes his top two receivers once again were Thompson and Davis While neither found the end zone on Sunday both continued their strong starts to the season Thompson notched his second career 100yard receiving game as the Florida State product became just the second Redskins running back with multiple 100yard receiving games in a season since 1960 In total he caught four passes for 105 yards highlighted by a 49yard reception on a 1 st and22 pass The offensive linemen are all blocking their guys great and Ive been given some oneonone opportunities and just winning those matchups Thompson said Thats pretty much the key to it I had three screen plays today my first three catches And my Oline did a great job downfield Jordan Reed the receivers all those guys did just a great job blocking for me Its on me to make plays and be a playmaker be a difference maker on this team Davis meanwhile avenged a third quarter fumble with a 51yard catchandrun in the fourth quarter in the first game facing the team that drafted him No 6overall in the 2006 NFL Draft Including a 69yard catch against Kansas City Davis has now posted a reception of 50 yards or more in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 56 of the 2013 season as a member of the 49ers 5 After not being able to do anything physical for two weeks Trent Williams played the entire game Originally suffering a knee injury during training camp earlier this year the issue resurfaced two weeks ago against the Kansas City Chiefs Missing four plays in the game Williams did not practice throughout the entire week leading up to Sundays home contest against the 49ers For most such an injury would keep them out for a few weeks But Williams isnt your average player The fivetime Pro Bowler said he knew he was going to be good on Saturday evening Just a few hours later he played all 70 offensive plays for Washington I didnt necessarily feel like myself but thats expected Williams admitted I havent done anything with football in the last two weeks I felt rusty It was kind of hard early trying to fight through the rust and everything but once you start getting in the flow of the game and the adrenaline starts rushing you kind of start to worry about the game more than anything Williams presence was certainly felt as the 2010 firstround pick didnt allow a young and talent defensive line any sacks from his side In total San Francisco tallied just one sack of Cousins For us man we know what weve got hes our leader said tackle Morgan Moses He doesnt have to practice all week but we know hes going to show up on the game Hes just mentally and physically there Thats what you expect out of a Pro Bowl tackle Cousins added that he wasnt entirely sure if Williams was going to play the entire game In the end though the quarterbacks sturdy left tackle was there for him You prepare for the worst and hope for the best and Trent did a great job playing through his injury Cousins said Im a little spoiled having him as a left tackle and when hes in there it makes a big difference', 'Download a PDF of the Redskins 2017 game vs the

is certainly a lot easier than actually doing it on the field Despite spending the 2016 season in retirement Lynch returned to the NFL this year following a trade from the Seattle Seahawks to his hometown Raiders While the sample size has been small so far 30 carries for 121 yards Lynch clearly hasnt missed a beat this year The Redskins know this and plan to be ready for the exact same player that has been named to five Pro Bowls and has six 1000yard seasons Its just going to be a group effort like it is with every great back in the NFL that you face said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Todd Gurleys a different type of back but you know it takes more than one He might jump over one guy and the next guys going to have to come get him Marshawn might stiff arm one guy but the next two or three guys are going to come get himIts got to be a group effort and weve got to run to the football all 11 of them on defense have got to pursue to the football with great passion Lynch is coming off a fairly light workload following Oaklands blowout victory over the New York Jets last Sunday He appeared on just 23 offensive plays and logged just 12 carries Redskins linebacker Mason Foster said the team needs to swarm to the ball whenever it is in Lynchs possession Everybodys going to have to tackle well and be physical but at the same time you know guys are going to miss because hes a great back but everybody has to be flying to the ball Foster said So if one guy misses or if one guy slips off someone is right there to make a tackle Its about team defense and its going to take all 11 guys to get to the ball Stephen Czarda CONTINUE THE BALANACED ATTACK Even though quarterback Kirk Cousins passed for nearly 5000 yards last season the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific so far this year After Cousins threw for just 240 yards and three touchdowns in an opening game loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Los Angeles Rams held the Pro Bowl quarterback to just 179 yards on 18 completions It was the fewest passing yards he had in a game since Week 17 of the 2015 season when he only played to the early minutes of the second quarter in a game one week after the Redskins clinched the NFC East While Washington certainly wants more production from Cousins the running game burst onto the scene last Sunday as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for more than 220 yards Facing an offense this week that can put up points in bunches a similar outing by the running backs could go a long way in getting the Redskins their first victory at FedExField this year Anytime you add balance into your offense it opens up all the different areas said tackle Trent Williams If you can run the ball it keeps the chains in manageable distance it opens up your playbook to a lot more options and plays that you can pick Gruden added that being multidimensional on offense is going to be important determining factor between wins and losses and the season wears on Attacking a Raiders defense that currently ranks 19 th against the run while getting the passing game clicking could keep Oakland off balance just enough to grab a victory The ability to run the ball is a great asset for us and its necessary for us to be successful longterm Gruden said For us to get to the playoffs and win Super Bowls we have to be balanced and we have to be able to run the ball to take the pressure off our quarterback and open up the play actions Stephen Czarda TURN THE CARR AROUND Coming into Week 3 Oaklands offense ranks fourth in the NFL in yards per game This no doubt is due to the so far flawless play of quarterback Derek Carr The fourthyear passer out of Fresno State has thrown five touchdowns this season with no interceptions In two games he has amassed 492 yards through the air and has only been sacked two times Gruden said thats where his team needs to excel getting to Carr before the ball leaves his hand It gets frustrating for pass rushers You know you say Rush the quarterback rush the quarterback and the balls gone at one point I think the average was under two seconds that he gets the ball out of his hands Gruden said Well get our hands up maybe bat some balls but still I think if you make the quarterback uncomfortable even if you dont get the sack it can be equally as important as getting the sack The Redskins defense who through two games has recorded four sacks will have its hands full trying to bring down the 6foot3 215pound Carr who sits behind a stellar offensive line and has plenty of talented receivers to dump the ball off to in no time Receiver Michael Crabtree for instance caught three touchdowns last week against the New York Jets Our defensive line and linebackers will be challenged Gruden said Theyre anxious Theyre excited It will be a great test Brandon Hill SHINE UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS FedExField will be at the forefront of the football world this weekend as the Redskins and Raiders do battle in 2017s third edition of Sunday Night Football Along with the Sunday Night game comes a national audience a primetime stage and an added sense of excitement for players and coaches alike Oh were excited head coach Jay Gruden said this week I think losing our opener home opener against Philadelphia hurt a little bit and were excited to get our next home game We know its going to be a great test For linebacker Mason Foster this is the type of game that he dreamed to play in as a kid Sunday night at home in front of our fans this is the game that you dream about playing Pop Warner Foster said You want that you dream of that Its exciting The Redskins have fared well on the Sunday Night Football stage recently beating a tough Green Bay Packers team 4224 in Week 11 of last season With a win this week it would mark the first time that the team has won two consecutive Sunday Night games since Weeks 1516 of the 2007 season On the alltime scale the Redskins record on Sunday Night Football sits close to the 500 mark at 18171 Jay Cannon', 'The Raiders were the team that brought Terrelle Pryor Sr into the NFL as he played quarterback for Oakland for a few seasons Now hes one of the Redskins starting wide receivers with a 1000yard receiving season under his belt Its a transition few have ever made and almost none have seen the same sort of early returns Terrelle Pryor Sr was best known as an Ohio StateturnedNFL quarterback who didnt quite pan out in the professional ranks Selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Supplemental Draft Pryor produced mediocre results in his two seasons as a quarterback for the Oakland Raiders Between the 201213 seasons Pryor completed 56 percent of his pass attempts with just nine touchdown passes to 12 interceptions With the Raiders in the market for a future franchise quarterback Pryor was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in April 2014 Despite offseason roster stints with the Seahawks Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns Pryor wouldnt appear in an NFL game again until Week 17 of the 2015 season as a wide receiver With his desire to continue playing football Pryor elected to make the switch to wide receiver It turned an NFL career in jeopardy into one of the best success stories of the 2016 season as Pryor totaled 77 receptions for 1007 yards and four touchdowns with the Browns He posted these numbers despite having almost no stability from Clevelands quarterback position Not many people have ever done it before but he is a big physical great athlete said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden And it helps to be 6foot5 and run a 43 40 yard dash I think had he made this decision sooner in his career I think hed be further along But being that he just made it not too long ago hes where he is I mean hes still one of the top guys in the league and he just started playing Hes a physical freak Indeed others who have gone from quarterback to wide receiver havent had 1000yard seasons like Pryor Former Redskins wide receiver Antwaan Randle El for example went from a college quarterback at Indiana to NFL wideout But he never posted more than 730 receiving yards in any of his nine professional seasons Most former quarterbacks you put them in a situation where now they are getting hit a lot more exposed a lot to a lot more situations in terms of the physical aspect of the game You think they tend to turn a lot of stuff down he doesnt do that said Redskins wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard He plays the game aggressively and hes made the transition well But the transition wasnt exactly as it looked on the field last year Pryor had to learn some of the simplest traits of the position let alone prepare for seasoned NFL defensive backs starring him down Tim Cortazzo my trainer he spent three four hours a day not just outside running routes but also going indoors running around cones because I really didnt know how to handle my body I didnt know how to adjust my body I didnt know how to take control of myself Pryor said Now Im at the point where I can control my body I know where Im going I know what I want to do to the defender I know how to stare at the guy in his eyes and make him think that Im doing something else and then try to do something else Thats what I continue to get better at stuff like that While hes now known as a wide receiver his background at the quarterback position hasnt gone to waste On the contrary hes benefitted from knowing what its like to be the one in charge of an offense I just like the fact that hes a very bright guy understands coverages understands where the ball should go and route concepts which is very big Gruden said He is a very smart receiver now its just about polishing up the little things and the details of each route and were working with him on that Polishing up the intricacies hasnt been perfect for Pryor as would be the case for any player making a change in their 20s after spending their entire upbringing at a different position Pryor was active on social media during the offseason showcasing his hard work posting almost daily his progress Some days of course were better than others But the 28yearold wanted to show people that his success last season was no fluke When you go and have an excellent season or do some great things people know why Pryor said of his workout videos on social media Little kids know why Maybe thatll get kids outside to work out more and work hard people that look up to me people that I inspire So I think thats another reason thats a little deeper for me Late in the offseason Pryor posted a series of workout videos that showed him both following and competing with AllPro Antonio Brown When I talk about a freak mind like a weirdo freak in terms of everything has to be perfect watching Antonio work out it just changed my whole mindset of how youre supposed to be as a wideout Pryor said Its just the little details I was telling you guys earlier hell do three four reps in a row and then hell take a break because that next rep he wants that to be 100 percent and he wants it to be perfect And thats all you want to do is chase perfection and thats what Im looking forward to and Im just going to continue to grow from that standpoint While his workout posts have decreased now that the season has arrived his mindset in terms of hard work pays off hasnt During the preseason Pryor would spend as much as 30 minutes after practice working with starting quarterback Kirk Cousins As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said last month We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time Cousins was appreciative of Pryors request to spend extra time together I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the Oakland Raiders Friday Sept 22

cornerback Josh Norman shoulder and safety Montae Nicholson shoulder are questionable for the Week 3 matchup with the undefeated Raiders Kelley suffered a rib injury during last Sundays 2720 victory over the Los Angeles Rams He got off to a strong start against Los Angeles defense running for 78 yards on just 12 carries before being removed from the game in the second quarter and not returning The secondyear Tulane product has been trying out different things this week to rid some of the pain including sleeping with pillows on his back But hes confident hell be active Sunday night I felt good overall period Kelley said this week after one of Washingtons practice sessions Just seeing if I have to go with the vest would it be more comfortable stuff like that So were just trying to figure little things out to make sure to protect it Reed meanwhile did not practice on Wednesday before returning Thursday under a limited workload The Pro Bowler got off to somewhat of a slow start by his standards in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles but returned to form some last week against the Rams If active Redskins head coach Jay Gruden expects Reed to be a nuisance for Oaklands defense I thought he had the best allaround game hes had in a while Gruden said I think not just routerunning but blocking He was outstanding in blocking Had a key block on the touchdown Chris Thompson had on the second series of the game was physical and did a great job But his routerunning has always been solid I might have been nitpicking the first week hes just a little too quick sometimes but hes still a great player and has done an excellent job for us As for Foster the seventhyear linebacker suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Rams but popped it back into place before making a gamesealing interception off Jared Goff The teams starting Mike linebacker said hes been taking it daybyday with his shoulder but without a second opinion needed is confident like Kelley hell be able to suit up Of course youre always going to be sore after a game but just keep getting treatment keep working and itll feel better Foster said As of right now just going in there getting my treatment doing whatever they tell me to do and keep getting ready For Nicholson the young safety will also be questionable for the contest as Washington determines how to utilize the strengths of both the rookie and Deshazor Everett who was limited in Wednesdays practice but was a full participant the past two days Everett got the starting nod in the regular season opener but the Redskins rotated in Nicholson more frequently against the Rams In fact it was Nicholson who started against Los Angeles appearing on more than half of the defenses plays He is a big physical guy that can run and we are excited about his prospects Gruden said of Nicholson Nothing against Everett we are just trying to get him out there and get him some reps We know how important that position is The last couple years we have had a lot of injuries so we are trying to get all our guys ready to play Montae has all the traits to be a great safety we just have got to get him in there and get him some

pretty good Defensive Coordinator Greg Manusky on what hes learned about the defense after two games 8 Only game in town Sunday night at home in front of our fans this is the game that you dream about

you surround yourself with a good organization the coaches are behind and actually believe in you and give you the opportunity then skys the limit Defensive lineman Ziggy Hood on how younger players can thrive in the NFL 6 Its always exciting to play on Sunday night You get in the sitting room and kind of watch everybody else play Its a good way to let some nerves outWhat its going to take to beat those guys is that we have to possess the ball we got to find a way to slow down their passrushers and also keep the ball out of their hands They have a very potent offense so we have to try to find a way to win the time of possession Left tackle Trent Williams on playing the Raiders on Sunday night 5 You can teach technique you can teach this and that but theyre ability to impose their will on defenders it really showed Sunday We just wanted to keep our foot on the throat not let up not give them any kind of hope We just wanted to keep pounding it and show everybody else that we will run

can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss There is just a lot to like and the other thing about Chris that you have to know from his story is it wasnt like he showed up as a rookie and was an AllPro It took time to develop and thats the case with so many guys in this league I think people like to write the book on somebody pretty quickly and I think we have to understand that guys take time to develop and I think Chris is still getting better and doing things this year that he didnt do last year So I am thrilled with his growth and development and cant wait to see where it goes from here Quarterback Kirk Cousins on playing with Chris Thompson 3 I am not going to stop him Hopefully I think its just going to be a group effort like it is with every great back in the NFL that you faceMarshawn might stiff arm one guy but the next two or three guys are

the game it is clear that Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch hasnt missed a step The Redskins are preparing for his best this Sunday Ever since he entered the league in 2007 with the Buffalo Bills Marshawn Lynch has left a profound mark on the NFL Off the field he has a charismatic vibrant personality that is mirrored by no one On the field he is a hardnosed bruiser of a running back that will likely end up in the Pro Football Hall of Fame some day Seemingly everything about Lynch is unique which provides the Redskins defense with a challenge as they prepare for Sunday nights showdown with the Raiders For a running back that has a reputation of being especially hard to bring to the ground team defense is the key noted several Redskins players and personnel Just swarm to the ball said linebacker Mason Foster this week So if one guy misses or if one guy slips off someone is right there to make a tackle Its about team defense and its going to take all 11 guys to get to the ball Head coach Jay Gruden has been stressing much of the same as his starting linebacker He also noted the challenge of going up against Los Angeles Rams running back Todd Gurley and Lynch in consecutive weeks two great running backs with two very different playing styles Gurley might jump over one guy and the next guys going to have to come get him Marshawn might stiff arm one guy but the next two or three guys are going to come get him Gruden said Its got to be a group effort and weve got to run to the football all 11 of them on defense have got to pursue to the football with great passion In his 11year career the running back has amassed more than 5600 rushing yards after contact and has broken over 600 tackles according to Pro Football Focus It should come as no surprise that Redskins players and coaches are emphasizing the importance of team defense ahead of Sunday nights matchup Lynch grabbed many headlines when he announced his retirement following the 2015 season at the age of 29 His retirement was of course shortlived as he is now back on the field with his hometown Raiders Despite the oneyear break from the game however Redskins coaches see much of the same great production from the 31yearold When asked if he saw any lag in Lynchs game after his year off Gruden responded quite bluntly No No lags He looks fine So far this season Lynch has totaled 121 rushing yards on 30 attempts and has scored one touchdown Ive played him many times Hes a beast said defensive coordinator Greg Manusky It is just like it is just like he is regular or has been the past couple years the same player that I remember when he was up in Buffalo and Seattle', 'Equipped with a quick release the Redskins want to make sure they finish any pressure they send on Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in this Sundays game For the Oakland Raiders 2014 may have well been a century ago That season thenrookie quarterback Derek Carr started his season 010 before finishing 313 The Raiders seemed doomed for many years of mediocrity with little hope in sight Thats when Carr turned things around Oaklands wins more than doubled in 2015 then in 2016 the team shot out the gate posting a 124 record The Raiders seemed like favorites to reach the AFC Championship Game before Carr went down with an injury and Oaklands dreams of a Super Bowl came crashing down In 2017 Carr has showed no signs of regression and looks even more dangerous than last season where he threw for 3937 yards and 28 touchdowns compared to six interceptions He has only been helped by the teams addition of offensive weapons The Raiders drafted Alabama wide receiver Amari Cooper in 2015 and added veteran receiver Michael Crabtree that same year With the 2017 season still very young Carr and Co looks just as good as a year before starting 20 with a meeting with the Washington Redskins looming on the horizon Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said there were not many weaknesses on the Raiders offense that his team could pinpoint Theres nothing theyre not doing well They can throw it they can run it so there you have it Gruden said They have a big powerful offensive line They have a couple tight ends that can come in and maul you They have great play actions and their receivers can get down the field And Derek Carr does an unbelievable job at giving them opportunity balls and they come down with the majority of them so our defensive backs will be challenged Carr has yet to throw an interception this season and already has five touchdowns under his belt He also has the leagues fastest release time after the snap usually finding an open receiver in 197 seconds Gruden said that can be frustrating for pass rushers and that the front seven needs hit Carr if they want to get in his head Despite the impressive passing stats Oaklands offense is far from onedimensional The Raiders signed Oakland native Marshawn Lynch to be one of their two featured running backs With Beast Mode in the backfield defenses have had trouble stopping this dynamic offense Redskins linebacker Mason Foster said it all comes to down the game plan Weve got great coaches so I know theyre going to have certain little things that you can do to alleviate the pressure off certain people in certain situations and let them go play Foster said Really weve got to execute and trust the process Were going to have a great plan coming in so youve just got to work on it throughout the week and get ready for Sunday Foster who suffered an injury in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Rams has been slow to recover and may not see the field on Sunday This would come as a great loss to the Redskins defense Foster sealed the victory for Washington against Los Angeles with a fourth quarter interception and has 14 tackles on the season Despite the setback Foster said he was hopeful for his chance to play one of the leagues best teams and said the defense needs to be on point if it hopes to bring Carr down Weve just got to execute Weve got great coaches guys have been flying around making plays Foster said Weve got to go out there have fun and make plays Thats really what it comes down to I feel like guys have been doing a good job Just go have fun and let it loose', 'The Redskins wide receiver has been excited about this weeks practice and is optimistic that things will start to click between him and Kirk Cousins this Sunday Wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr entered the locker room in uplifted spirits on Thursday afternoon Despite a sore ankle and a frustrating start to his season which has been characterized more by his dropped passes than his positive plays he spoke to the media looking forward to Sunday nights game against the Raiders brimming with optimism Im mad sometimes when I walk in here every single day Pryor said If you see me and Im mad its probably like I want to fix something something happened I may have had a good day in practice or something like thatIm pretty excited right now Im feeling good The reason for his excitement stems from his practice week in which Pryor and quarterback Kirk Cousins have been gaining a better connection Their rapport has been under intense scrutiny for most of the preseason even while theyve stayed late after practices working on timing as the firstteam offense struggled early in games but Pryor believes the issues are working themselves out Sometimes people dont see that like right now every single day this week was phenomenal between myself and Kirk even though I didnt practice as much he said But the connection were getting and the connection were building on up is great and its hard to see for people but on the inside youre like man this is getting exciting Pryor has eight catches on 15 targets for 97 yards receiving in the first two games of the season He offered up that the reason behind his slow start is part of a leaguewide trend for bigtime receivers that have changed teams in the offseason Noting Alshon Jeffery and Brandin Cooks Pryor expects production to increase in the coming weeks because you start fill in blanks what am I comfortable with what is he comfortable with what is he real good at and then it starts to really cook up So Im getting excited Cousins has shared the same sentiment about the passing offense as a whole While the run game relieved some of the burden on his shoulders last week Cousins hasnt thrown for more than 250 yards in a game yet Still hes remained confident that the parts will come together soon and the offense as hes known it will come together again A lot of the throws we did complete or balls that were thrown were good accurate passes and so we felt good about that Cousins said of his first two games So thats where I think head coach Jay Gruden says we are really close because youre a touchdown pass away and a couple other situations from really having a big day I think that is where we say we are close I think so many times we come away from games saying If we wouldve done this if we wouldve done that There are always those plays that can put you over the edge so we have got to find ways to continue to make those plays so that we arent saying that as often when we walk away from the game Sundays game will also mark a reunion for Pryor with the team that took him in the 2011 supplemental draft His time at quarterback never panned out the way he hoped nor did it with a few other teams leading to his release He stopped thinking about making it as a quarterback by the time he was released a third time in as many years by the Cincinnati Bengals equating the feeling to a woman breaking up with him the best way I can explain it he said Those feelings still sit with him Im motivated every day he said Coming to practice every day this is a great week of practice Im looking to step up my game and do big things As hes reflected more about his unique shift to wide receiver he said doesnt miss playing quarterback as much as he thought Thats mostly a symptom of watching dynamic defensive players find their way to the backfield and pull down quarterbacks You start seeing Kirk sometimes getting hit or you see other

threeandout highlighted by a big hit delivered on Michael Crabtree from Montae Nicholson Oakland would strike back after a Samaje Perine fumble but Washingtons defense held strong in the red zone to

'The Washington Redskins look to stop Kansas Citys impressive early season run in the second nationally televised game of the season a Monday Night Football meeting The Kansas City Chiefs already defeated one NFC East team this season and but the Washington Redskins will look to get the best of their AFC West foe The Redskins will once again hit the road to play at Arrowhead Stadium in a Monday Night matchup The game will be nationally televised on ESPN with an 830 pm EST kickoff Kansas City will have 13year veteran Alex Smith under center for his fifth season as a Chief In the Chiefs impressive 2017 debut against New England Smith threw for 368 passing yards with an 80 percent completion rate He combined that with four touchdown passes leading the Chiefs offense to a 4227 upset win over the defending Super Bowl champions Smiths numbers however were not the biggest surprise of the night Rookie Kareem Hunt started at tailback after Spencer Ware injured himself during the offseason Hunt fumbled his first snap of the game but quickly turned things around gaining 148 yards and a score Meanwhile Washington has seen an impressive surge in the run game as well During the Redskins 2720 win over the Los Angeles Rams in Week 2 running back Chris Thompson recorded 77 yards on the ground and two touchdowns Thompson was not Washingtons leading rusher as Rob Kelley ran for 78 yards and started for most of the game Kelley however went down with a rib cartilage injury If Kelley is unable to return for Sundays game against the Chiefs it will be up to Thompson and rookie Samaje Perine to lead the rushing attack Three weeks into the season the Chiefs and Redskins already have a shared opponent In Week 2 Kansas City thwarted Philadelphias attempt to top the NFC East In that game the Chiefs offense again found a rhythm early Smith threw for 251 yards and a touchdown and Hunt found 81 yards on the ground along with two touchdowns In the passing attack Kansas City did not rely on its speedy receivers but instead turned to tight end Travis Kelce The 6foot5 260pound playmaker hauled in eight catches for 103 yards including a 15yard touchdown where Kelce hurdled a defender and came crashing into the end zone Washingtons tallest defensive starters linebackers Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith will have quite the chore covering Kelce especially if head coach Andy Reid decides to send him deep down the field The difference in the game could come down to Kansas Citys secondary In Week 2 the Chiefs allowed 333 yards through the air This should prove promising for Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins who looked on point against the Rams throwing for 179 yards and avoided an interception while tossing a gamewinning touchdown late in the fourth quarter That combined with an improved offensive line should mean that Washington attacks the Chiefs secondary early and often The last time Washington and Kansas City met was in 2013 The Redskins lost the home game 4510 Washington has had poor luck against the Chiefs dropping the last six contests The Redskins have not won a game since 1983 and the Chiefs lead the alltime series 81', 'After a slow start to the season the Redskins put together a complete offensive game running and passing the ball with equal production to earn their second victory Despite its uneven production over its first two games Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins was confident last week that the teams offense was on the brink of breaking out He mentioned the early dropped passes mistakes and hesitations that left the team regretful but optimistic that with the right corrections a big game was in store Eventually those mishaps would be cleaned up Sunday night on a national stage at FedExField Cousins and the Redskins offense confirmed his belief beating the Oakland Raiders 2710 and providing the blueprint for how each facet should operate in unison The attack looked clean efficient and had the flashes of brilliance that head coach Jay Gruden had been waiting to see erupt from his quarterback and stable of weapons In essence the Redskins made the plays they expected from themselves Cousins made smart decisions with the football completing 25of30 passes for 365 yards three touchdowns and no interceptions He distributed the ball to eight different receivers using a diversity of throws to connect on reliable short and screen passes and for the first time this season the deep ball He was also for the second consecutive game afforded a run game which tallied 116 yards to anchor his arm It was enough to pile up 472 total yards and a renewed confidence in Cousins and the talent around him against a strong Oakland defense You can look at the yards and say obviously I like the yards and the completion percentage but really I think there were some decisions that Kirk made that were equally as impressive not forcing the ball running the ball when we had a couple of bad looks protecting the football head coach Jay Gruden said We had a third down and five and he ran it we kicked a field goal to go up 17 he couldve forced it in there and made a bad decision I think he really managed the game perfectly He made some bigtime throws the receivers made some plays for him so all around I was very impressed with the entire offense moving the ball The scoring started early and provided a window into the rest of the nights crisp play Without tight end Jordan Reed in the lineup Vernon Davis stepped up to fill the void grabbing a 26yard pass over the middle beautifully placed into his outstretched hands to convert on the first third down which the Redskins handled 7of15 times Sunday night After several small gains from running back Samaje Perine Cousins then found Chris Thompson wide open to his left and the running back began another memorable night with a 22yard touchdown catch and run Thompson would figure mightily into the offensive production again he totaled 150 yards receiving and 38 yards rushing on the night as would Davis who caught Cousinss second touchdown pass a 19yard strike that hit him in stride to extend Washingtons lead in the second quarter Even with its numerous setbacks the majority of them drivekilling penalties the offense continued to play a complete game dominating in time of possession the Redskins racked more than 38 minutes compared to the Raiders 21 and feeding off the defenses continual quick stops As Thompson said our defense when they play that way it makes the offense play even harder Perine ran the ball for 49 yards and milked the clock throughout drives while Jamison Crowder Ryan Grant and Terrelle Pryor Sr all helped extending drives on third down The most noteworthy and electric strike came in the third quarter when Cousins lofted a deep pass down the right sideline to wide receiver Josh Doctson the teams firstround pick last year who was without a catch in this young season Using all of the physical tools he has been gifted Doctson leapt over Raiders cornerback David Amerson and grabbed the football in front of him forcing his way into the end zone after landing for a 52yard touchdown the first of his career Any time you start fast you know its up and down plays happen you can easily give the ball back quarterback Kirk Cousins said You can have a bad decision here or there and miss the read The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played There remain items to correct and improvements to be made But this output was a sign that the pieces to the offensive puzzle are taking shape moving from abstraction to clarity This is what we want and I believe thats what we know were capable of doing Thompson said So we just have to continue to get better every day in practice and then come out here and execute and Coach Gruden Ive said it so many times He just called the perfect plays He called all the right plays and the right times and it was just on us to win our matchups I think everybody collectively did a good job today', 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was an 11play 72yard scoring drive finished off by a Vernon Davis 18yard touchdown catch that gave the Redskins a twoscore lead Without tight end Jordan Reed available Sunday night against the Raiders quarterback Kirk Cousins and the Redskins leaned on Vernon Davis to make up for any lost production Once again the veteran tight end came through After already snagging a 26yard pass in the first quarter to convert on the teams first thirddown which led to an opening drive touchdown Davis continued to be a reliable target In the second quarter he streaked over the middle beating cornerback Sean Smith and grabbed a perfectly placed pass near the back of the end zone for the Redskins second touchdown of the night It capped an 11play 72yard drive that ate up six minutes and 10 seconds in the teams decisive 2710 victory over Oakland the product of another balanced offensive attack It looked to me that they did split safety coverage They played man up on Vernon Cousins said The goal was to beat his man down the field to find a seam between the two safeties and I just have to throw it out there Vernon is a big asset to our team You know that Jordan Reed is not always healthy The fact that Vernon has the speed that he has and the experience and can make the plays with the last year and half what an asset to our offense The drive started on the Washington 28yard line where running back Samaje Perine filling in for an injured Rob Kelley rushed for nine and then three yards on consecutive plays to pick up a first down Cousins dropped back and found wide receiver Ryan Grant for 11 yards near the sideline and the back and forth air and ground game continued Perine rushed for eight yards then Cousins rolled to his right and found wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr by the sideline for 12 more The Redskins collected several more short yardage plays including a twoyard pass to Davis and a sixyard pass to wide receiver Jamison Crowder on a slant route to convert on third down After the first negative passing play of the drive to Crowder Cousins dropped back and found Davis showing off his speed to beat the corner in front of him Davis celebrated with his signature jump shot now a legal move and put the ball through the goal posts and into the stands It was one of those plays that we run in practice Davis said They called it I made the proper moves that I was supposed to make just

that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 In a complete performance on national television the Redskins dominated the Raiders Despite Oakland entering FedExField with a 20 record and being considered one of the best teams in the NFL it was Washington who put on a complete showing Sunday evening From the getgo Washington controlled Oakland On just the second play from the line of scrimmage the Redskins intercepted a Derek Carr pass Eight plays after the Montae Nicholson pick the Redskins would score a 22yard touchdown between Kirk Cousins and Chris Thompson It laid the foundation for a onesided affair throughout the evening Cousins would finish the night 25of30 for 365 yards and three touchdowns Thompson continued his strong start to the year with 150 receiving yards and the defense allowed just 128 yards fewest surrendered since the 1992 season I think it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody to hold that offense with Marshawn Lynch and Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper the list goes on and on said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden 0for11 on third downs I mean its a great tribute to Coach Greg Manusky and the staff but the players were executing Hustling Making sure of tackles and getting the ball out when they had to In total the Redskins outgained the Raiders 472128 yards The 344yard differential was the largest in regular season action for Washington since Dec 15 1974 a span of 660 regular season games The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding Cousins said All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played 2 The country got to see Chris Thompsons breakout campaign continue Even before Sunday game against the Raiders Thompson was one of the leagues best performers through the first two weeks of the season He had the beautiful touchdown reception in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and then followed it up with two scores against the Los Angeles Rams But Thompsons best game on the young season came against the Raiders as the fourthyear running back logged six receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown It was the most receiving yards in a game by any Redskins running back in records available dating back to 1960 surpassing the 140 receiving yards by running back Dick James on Dec 16 1962 His 188 yards from scrimmage were also the most by any member of the Redskins since Alfred Morris 200yard performance against the Dallas Cowboys Week 17 of the 2012 season I cant explain it said Thompson with a smile when asked about his performance Everybody all around just did a good job for me I got a lot of good looks Our offensive line did such a great job Kirk also he did such a great job just finding me Coach Gruden I think he deserves all of the credit for the offense I think he just called the perfect plays at the right time My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing It was such a great job by him I cant really take a lot of the credit Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays Thompsons best play of his 28 offensive snaps came in the third quarter when he turned a screen pass on 3 rd and19 into a 74yard gain Benefitting from great blocking out of the entire offensive line and Terrelle Pryor Sr Thompson raced down the sideline to not only prevent Oakland from getting the ball back but setting up a Dustin Hopkins field goal Hes a great player man Gruden said Now we have to keep him healthy and hes in a great role where hes at Hes going to be very effective working in third downs a lot were in second down and long a lot He will be utilized in those roles quite frequently 3 The defense heard all about the Raiders offense but quickly put an end to the hoopla surrounding Oaklands unit The defense hadnt had a performance like this in years Not only were the 128 total yards surrendered the teams fewest in 25 seasons Washington held Oakland to just 32 rushing yards fewest since the 2014 season and 96 net passing yards fewest since the 2008 season Despite Oaklands smash mouth style of play it was Washington who set the tempo Marshawn Lynch was bottled up any time he touched the ball and the defense flustered Carr into his first multiinterception game since the 2015 season The defense also sacked him four times We just plan on being physical every game said Jonathan Allen who recorded his first NFL sack off Carr I feel like that is something we want to build as an identity here I feel like we did a good job of doing that You have to give a lot of credit to Jim Tomsula and Greg Manusky coming up with a great game plan and DBs helped us a lot by covering them so we actually have time to get back there and we stopped the run Washingtons defense was at its best on third downs an area theyve struggled with in recent years Oakland had 11 third down attempts They wouldnt convert a single one Our goal was to stop the run and then get off on third down Nicholson said That is pretty much our goal every week I think we did that pretty well Like I said they have a great offense Even to do that it is just a step in the right direction for us Next up is Kansas City so we will go in and just go to work again Thats all we can do 4 Josh Doctson finally struck with a highlight reel touchdown catch In his most extensive NFL action to date Doctson finally found the end zone on one of the best catches during Sundays action After being targeted earlier on the third quarter drive one in which Doctson would drop the ball with David Amerson all over his back the 2016 firstround pick shook off the play to sky over the former Washington cornerback for a 52yard touchdown Despite Cousins slightly underthrowing the deep bomb Doctson adjusted to sky over Amerson and haul the ball in before trotting into the end zone for his first career touchdown It actually came out of the fake trying to throw it to Terrelle and I think Terrelle did end up winning late but I felt 38 TJ Carrie I believe was covering Terrelle was getting out of there and I felt like he was taking away the go ball and if Terrelle did end up getting by him it just shows how fast he really is Cousins said Then I looked back over to Josh and Davis Amerson was getting deep as well but I do like Joshs ball skills and his ability to catch the ball up in the air and I thought you know what Im going to give him a chance they have been asking me to give him that chance and lets give it to him It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Thats why this game is so tough Gruden said it was great to see Doctson finish the play with such ease after having a rough start to his time in Washington due to various injuries I think the players have seen him do that in practice quite often but nobody else has Gruden said You guys dont even get a chance to see it very often so it was good to get Kirk get the ball out of his hands and it wasnt a perfectly thrown ball but to give him a chance where he can go up and make a big time catch hopefully well get more of that But it was great to see man Im happy for Josh and happy that Kirk threw it 5 For the second straight Sunday Night Football game at FedExField the Redskins put on a show While the Redskins have struggled at times in nationally televised games two of Washingtons best performances over the last two years have come on Sunday Night Football Last November the Redskins powered past the Packers for a 4224 victory before silencing the Raiders Sunday with a 2710 victory in a contest that was more lopsided than the final score It marks the first time the Redskins have won backtoback appearances on Sunday Night Football while pushing the teams alltime record on the broadcast package to 18171 Although the game pushed the Redskins season record to 21 players and coaches alike downplayed the significance of the performance Its big but it is not at the same time Nicholson said That sounds weird but its big because like you said it is Sunday Night Football It is primetime Like I said they have a great offense but it isnt at the same time because its our third game Its still early in the season There is still a lot to build on still a lot of corrections to make but like I said it is early in the season I think we will get it together towards the end Gruden added that he didnt care if it was prime time or 1 oclock or midnight He just wanted his team to defend home turf once again We had lost the last two or three at home which was disappointing so to get one at home have it on prime time against a big time team like the Raiders that was satisfying But now we just have to celebrate it for a little bit and then get ready for a tough one Monday night at

the season Redskins wide receiver Josh Doctson tallied a highlight reel catch over David Amerson on a 52yard touchdown When the Washington Redskins selected Josh Doctson in the first round of the 2016 NFL Draft it was easy to see why the wide receiver was picked so early A unanimous AllAmerican during his senior season at TCU Doctsons college highlights were acrobatic catch after acrobatic catch But it wasnt until Week 3 of the 2017 season that the Redskins finally got to see Doctsons potential and it was on full display for a nationally televised audience Doctsons rookie season marred by a lingering Achilles injury was of course shut down after just two games with two receptions His productive remained limited during the first two games of his second campaign but that all changed in Sundays 2710 victory over the Oakland Raiders In the third quarter with the Redskins already ahead by two touchdowns Doctson logged a 52yard touchdown reception after leaping over former Washington cornerback David Amerson It actually came out of the fake trying to throw it to Terrelle Pryor Sr and I think Terrelle did end up winning late but I felt 38 TJ Carrie I believe was covering Terrelle was getting out of there and I felt like he was taking away the go ball and if Terrelle did end up getting by him it just shows how fast he really is said quarterback Kirk Cousins Then I looked back over to Josh and David Amerson was getting deep as well but I do like Joshs ball skills and his ability to catch the ball up in the air and I thought you know what Im going to give him a chance they have been asking me to give him that chance and lets give it to him It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Thats why this game is so tough After securing the ball over Amersons head Doctson would land with both feet in before scampering into the end zone for his first NFL touchdown He would then spike the ball in celebration before his teammates joined him in appreciation of his efforts Its just natural Doctson said My body just goes man Its just God given talent so I mean its not much just attacking the ball In recent weeks Redskins head coach Jay Gruden has noted numerous times that the team is high on Doctsons potential but the secondyear wide receiver needs to string together positive and healthy practice sessions After a week of full participation at practices Doctson capped off Washingtons offensive explosion with his second career 50yard reception It was great to see him because Ive seen it I think the players have seen him do that in practice quite often but nobody else has Gruden said You guys dont even get a chance to see it very often so it was good to get Kirk get the ball out of his hands and it wasnt a perfectly thrown ball but to give him a chance where he can go up and make a big time catch hopefully well get more of that But it was great to see man Im happy for Josh and happy that Kirk threw it Redskins cornerback Bashaud Breeland had seen it in practice before as hes been in Amersons shoes before Man Joshs done that in practice to all of us Breeland said with a smile Everybody get got by Josh Im just excited for him to see him do it in a game Battling against him in practice hes got good body control good hands He can locate the ball in the air and I expected that play from him Weve all been got by Josh Doctson', 'For the second consecutive week the analysts on NFL Networks NFL Gameday chose in unanimous fashion against the Redskins when making their daily game picks And for the second week in a row the Redskins made them look silly for doing so Players find motivation in a variety of ways but for Redskins safety DJ Swearinger these predictions on this particular show have provided more than enough bulletin board material for him and the entire defense Swearinger has posted about these misguided predictions on consecutive Sundays exposing the fact that the Redskins are not a team to underestimate So far hes been right and the underdog mentality has benefited a defense thats been eager to prove itself which it did in front of a national audience during the teams 2710 victory over the Raiders We knew nobody gave us a chance Swearinger said I got to Tweet it out again NFL Network taking Oakland five times just like they did Los Angeles last week They dont respect us I told the boys you got to earn your respect in this league and we didnt earn our respect tonight we will continue to fight until we get our respect In a broad perspective it seems unreasonable to worry about what the same group of media pundits have to say about the Redskins But then again look at the way the Redskins defense has played in their last two matchups specifically its dominating performance against Oakland holding them to just 128 total yards Swearingers organization of meetings and vocal huddles have made this group play inspired football Whatever inspiration is guiding him deserves some kind of validation I said nobodys going to give us a chance to win Swearinger said The NFL wants the Oakland Raiders to come in Washington and beat up on the Washington Redskins and as a defense were not going to let that happen Regardless of what the offense and special teams do we control the game if they dont score they dont win and whichever the offense how many yards they put up tonight rushing yards passing yards I mean I think our defense stood up and really made a statement on the number one offense in the league Swearinger said that the meetings the defense had last week will become weekly a way to refocus to start the practice week and find new sources of motivation We have two meetings a week on Tuesday and Thursday so we are going to keep the chemistry up keep everybody moving keep getting better he said And so after such a dominating performance the nickname Swearinger instituted for the defensive backs group Flight Marshals gained more relevance We control everything in air Swearinger said Like we say we are going to get on this flight its going to be a long flight we are going to keep everyone in their seatbelts we are going to keep the red light on So the wide receivers they got to stay in their seatbelt We are going to keep the red light and I think we kept that red light on tonight I dont think nobody got up for water The Chiefs will try to next week Its possible that the NFL Gameday hosts choose Kansas City in unanimous fashion again after their impressive 30 start and with them playing at home Monday night in front of their faithful Swearinger might not like it but after the past two results it might be just what the defense needs again', 'The Redskins quarterback is one of three nominees for Week 3 FedEx Air Player of the Week after throwing for 365 yards and three touchdowns in a victory over the Raiders After tearing through the Oakland Raiders on Sunday Night Football Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins is a FedEx Air Player of the Week nominee You can cast your vote for him here Cousins was near perfect on Sunday evening in a 2710 victory at FedExField in Landover Md as the sixthyear quarterback completed 25of30 attempts for 365 yards with three touchdowns to no interceptions It was the third game in the last two years that Cousins threw for at least 350 yards with three touchdowns to no interceptions After completing scores to Chris Thompson and Vernon Davis in the first and second quarters respectively Cousins capped of his night by hitting Josh Doctson on a 52yard bomb in which the secondyear wide receiver climbed above David Amerson to haul in the ball It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Cousins admitted Thats why this game is so tough Cousins is up against New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Minnesota Vikings quarterback Case Keenum When the winners for FedEx Air and Ground Player of the Week are announced FedEx will make a 2000

Nation A Look Around The League', 'After a couple of playerheld meetings earlier in the week the Redskins defense broke out in major fashion Sunday night against the Raiders with an historical performance in front of a national audience The disrespect festered and lay heavy on the defenses minds throughout the week Safety DJ Swearinger saw it as an opportunity He called a meeting on Tuesday to challenge everyone for the practice week ahead then held another Thursday at cornerback Josh Norman s house to hammer home the message Swearinger called these gatherings get right meetings a sobriquet meant to take the noise from the week an opponent predicting his offensive numbers and analysts betting against them and channel it into a dominating performance to show a national audience why it was so wrong to make assumptions without accounting for this newlook unit From the opening drive the enhanced focus was on full display and the Redskins defense marked by a physical abandon and determination unseen in years past turned an otherwise potent Raiders offensive attack into an insecure and feeble one Washingtons 2710 victory signified many things but none were more noticeable than what the defense achieved what it felt it needed to prove under the lights Sunday night We wanted to change the culture around from the defense from last year to this year I think we made a statement to the world today Swearinger said We got to keep building Its only one game but a great game a hell of a game by our defense by our team to get the team win and we can keep building on this The unquestionable vocal leader of the defense Swearinger heard his message reverberate on the first pass play when rookie Montae Nicholson made an acrobatic interception the first of his career against quarterback Derek Carr The momentum only enhanced from there The defense applied consistent pressure all night without much reinforcement sacking Carr four times and hitting running back Marshawn Lynch early and often One of those hits on Lynch belonged to Swearinger who stood by his locker after the game dressed in a Sean Taylor jersey and donning a Redskins Mexican straw hat calling the violent tackle an ode to his legacy I told the boys all week I said yall going to love it when I catch 24 Lynch Swearinger said I was tired of hearing Beast Mode the dancing all of that I said Im going to catch him I will catch him this game and Im so happy I got to catch him I played him my rookie year and I never got to tackle him my rookie year he retired I tip my hat to Beast Mode I played running back he was my favorite running back growing up But when I got to this level and I wanted to play against him it was more of a enemy So I was happy I got a lick on him today It wasnt just Swearinger laying out the hits Nicholson punished wide receiver Michael Crabtree with a forceful collision to the chest late in the game after the receiver couldnt catch a deep pass in midair Linebacker Zach Brown sped over and flattened anyone in his way slamming them to the ground and the defensive line led by outside linebackers Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith shed blocks with ease In total the Redskins limited the Raiders to 128 total yards the lowest total during head coach Jay Grudens tenure in Washington and the fewest yards allowed by the Redskins since Oct 12 1992 against Denver They also held the Raiders 0for11 on third downs the first time the Redskins have held an opponent without a third down conversion in 10 years Guys were hungry Smith said Guys were trying to hunt thats what our coach says Go out there and hunt We got to get to the quarterback with four guys we shouldnt have to blitz and there wasnt many blitzes called I dont think there was any called and we got inaudible with our four guys up front The defense forced two more turnovers in the game cornerback Kendall Fuller got his first career interception against Carr who threw for just 118 yards and then forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that linebacker Martrell Spaight scooped before running out of bounds and it was clear each unit impacted the next Plastering receivers for four quarters cornerback Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland worked in tandem to limit the Raiders biggest threats Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper to just two total receptions for 13 yards For Norman it was poetic justice and the cornerback didnt mince his words about their performances I mean first and foremost you dont come in here and say what you are going to put up on somebody Norman said Twohundred yards He didnt even catch two balls Oh he only caught one So please whatever you do do not run your mouth to your wide receiver and respect to show up on Sundays Because I am telling you we are here and we are waiting Dont come out here and telling me what youre going to do Show me Youll have to run through me to get that And we aint letting that happen So whatever that young cat said cool youre going to take it back The complete game was enough for Gruden to say it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody Under a new defensive coordinator and with personnel that continues to show its speed intelligence and physicality the Redskins defense made a statement it hopes will continue to grow in the weeks to come We wanted to send a message to the world and were not pushovers were not going to lay down for nobody we are going to compete every time were on the field Swearinger said This defense is definitely going to be stingy every time we are on the field and we are going to keep it rolling We got to keep it rolling we got a big game Monday night next week and we can get better from this week Well watch it on Tuesday and get better and well try to be better on Monday', 'Two of the Redskins young defensive backs that have been making early impacts this season both recorded first half interceptions in Washingtons Week 3 victory In a game that was paced by the Redskins defense secondyear cornerback Kendall Fuller and rookie safety Montae Nicholson were at the forefront of attention each grabbing their first career interceptions Nicholson playing in just his third professional game and making his first start with the Redskins wasted no time in making his mark on the primetime affair On Derek Carrs first pass attempt of the night he aired out a deep ball to speedster Amari Cooper who seemingly had his man beat Almost out of nowhere Nicholson flew into sight outjumped Cooper and tumbles to the ground with the ball The rookies pick set the tone in what was a statement game from the Redskins defense Watching film DJ Swearinger and the defensive backs as a whole have been telling me to read his eyes when I am back there in half and that is what I was doing Nicholson said after the game I cant believe he actually threw it but when he threw it it was just a ball in the air it has got to be ours thats what we preach and I just kind of went up there and grabbed it Fullers interception came in the second quarter with the Redskins in front 70 Carr was looking for wide receiver Seth Roberts on a key 3rdand1 play but did not anticipate Fuller jumping the route and hauling down the interception After the game Fuller attributed his pick to the film study he did on Carr during the week The game film he watched on Carr Fuller said helped him figure out when he tends to throw to a receivers back shoulder which he attempted to do on the interception as well as his general timing on routes The big nights from young players like Fuller and Nicholson are especially important considering the overall struggles of the defensive backfield last year The Redskins held the Raiders to just 96 passing yards on the night and forced two interceptions Nicholson and Swearinger who both made their presences felt on Sunday night have already found some budding chemistry Hes been playing great As a rookie to come in and play as well as hes doing I tip my hat to him Swearinger said of his fellow safety With what we got going I think we can be one of the great tandems in this league for a good while The Redskins secondary is a mixed bag as it stands right now It features veterans like Swearinger and Josh Norman while also sporting an essence of youth with guys like Nicholson and Fuller Regardless of age the secondary which Swearinger dubs The Flight Marshals got contributions from essentially every member of the unit on Sunday night We prepared We prepared a lot the whole week Fuller said after the game Tuesday Wednesday Thursday you know guys like JNo Josh Norman DJ pushing us to be great That is what we have got to do week in and week out', 'Check out the top images from the Washington Redskins 2017 Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders that took placed at FedExField in Landover Md', 'Quarterback play from the Redskins was flawless Sunday night as Kirk Cousins elevated the offense with 360plus yards and three touchdown tosses Heading into the primetime matchup of the Oakland Raiders and Washington Redskins it was Oakland quarterback Derek Carr turning heads and leaving whispers of an MVP run in his wake Through two games Carr had yet thrown an interception had been sacked only once and had the quickest release time of all NFL quarterbacks Meanwhile Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins was quietly leading the Redskins offense to a lastminute win against the Los Angeles Rams after a rough showing in Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles On paper Carr looked like he was going to be the one having the edge during the Week 3 matchup between the two quarterbacks at FedExField in Landover Md After one passing play by the Raiders though it was clear the script had been flipped On Oaklands second play from scrimmage Carr heaved the ball downfield to receiver Amari Cooper Miscommunication caused Cooper to slow down and the ball sailed over his head and into the waiting arms of safety Montae Nicholson Cousins had been gifted early possession with relatively good field position and the quarterback seized the opportunity On Washingtons first pass play the sixthyear veteran found tight end Vernon Davis streaking toward the right sideline Cousins delivered a strike that Davis hauled in with ease and the Redskins quickly found themselves in Raiders territory The fact that Vernon has the speed that he has and the experience and can make the plays with the last year and half What an asset to our offense Cousins said Another guy thats a great teammate great person he carries himself well You just love going to work with him every day Five plays later Cousins wisely dumped the ball off to running back Chris Thompson before the Raiders blitz could get to him Thompson handled the rest zooming 22 yards for a score The Redskins defense stifled Carr for the entire first half giving the Washington offense lots of time on the field Cousins took his time behind a muchimproved offensive line hitting Terrelle Pryor Sr inches from the sideline A first down pass to receiver Jamison Crowder put the Redskins back in a position to score This time Cousins tossed a dime to Davis who had barely outrun the double coverage in the end zone It looked to me that they did split safety coverage Cousins said They played man up on Vernon The goal was to beat his man down the field to find a seam between the two safeties and I just have to throw it out there In the second half Cousins finally found success in the deep ball something he has hesitated to try this season On first down Cousins dropped back and threw a jump ball to receiver Josh Doctson Leaping over cornerback David Amerson Doctson miraculously landed on his feet with the ball secured Before Amerson could register what happened Doctson was already across the goal line I think the players have seen him do that in practice quite often but nobody else has said Washington head coach Jay Gruden It wasnt a perfectly thrown ball but to give him a chance where he can go up and make a big time catch hopefully well get more of that But it was great to see man Im happy for Josh and happy that Kirk threw it Cousins last big play of the game came at the hands and feet of Thompson who took a screen pass on 3rdandlong 74 yards With the lead secured Washington dialed up the run game and Cousins could fully enjoy his best performance of the season The fact that it was a full four quarter performance Cousins said I felt that was outstanding', 'Throughout the 2017 season the Redskins Blog will

practice squad WR Dres Anderson', 'Through three games linebacker Preston Smith has nearly totaled his sack output from last season a growing sign hes taking the right steps in 2017 To finish out his rookie season outside linebacker Preston Smith put together an impressive run recording five sacks in the Redskins final three games and propelling them into the playoffs The raw athleticism had come together in a potent way and Washington saw glimpses of a fruitful future His sophomore season however had its setbacks Smith struggled to translate his power spread throughout his 6foot5 265pound frame He started every game but amassed just 45 sacks finding trouble finishing plays when he managed to get near the quarterback Last year from a statistical standpoint he didnt have as many sacks as wed like head coach Jay Gruden said He was around the quarterback quite often and he missed a few here and there So far Smiths third year in the league has been a different story and his quick burst off the line and ability to shed blocks has produced tangible results for the defense in the way the team envisioned when they drafted him in the second round of the 2015 NFL Draft Smith has a sack in each of the teams first three games a streak he hasnt accomplished since the end of his rookie year And while that may be a small sample size it is a promising start nonetheless on a defense that has gained a new confidence under coordinator Greg Manusky On Oaklands second offensive series last Sunday after a sack shared by defensive lineman Jonathan Allen and linebacker Junior Galette it was Smiths turn to join the fun He ripped around the edge mostly untouched and gobbled up Carr to force fouth down Me getting to the quarterback is just based off the coverage and the rushes of the guys next to me rushing to make sure that we contain the quarterback and we keep him in the pocket Smith said Lately as it seems hes standing in the pocket and Ive just been falling on him Smith also showed off his strength on the next sequence singlehandedly taking down running back Marshawn Lynch on thirdand1 as he tried to escape around the outside arguably the most impressive tackle of the night We knew what we had to do Smith said We came in we knew we cant let Derek Carr get hot because hes one of the best quarterbacks in this league arguably the best We knew we had to stop him and we knew we couldnt let Beast Mode have a Beast mode game This year I think hes starting to wrap them up and get the production everyones looking for and waiting for Gruden said Hes a big body works hard hes working on his pass rush moves and a variety of them now so I think the futures very bright for Preston Smith obviously and then you throw Junior Galette in there We can keep them fresh with Ryan Anderson and Ryan Kerrigan so weve got a good mix of four guys that can rush and Chris Carter also so we keep them fresh and the rotation sound The defense set a tone to emulate for the rest of the season and the depth the Redskins have at outside linebacker starting with Kerrigan and continuing with Galette Anderson and Chris Carter will certainly help them sustain it If Smith continues his strong start showing he can play consistently at a high level throughout the year the dominant pass rush should only get better Preston is doing a good job Gruden said He can go inside he can use his bull rush and hes working on his get off So I think hes getting better and better', 'Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins has earned his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor after a 365yard threetouchdown performance last Sunday Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins has once again been named NFC Offensive Player of the Week after his performance against the Oakland Raiders in Sundays 2710 victory at FedExField in Landover Md From the getgo Cousins was sharp against Oaklands defense as he completed all three of his passes on Washingtons opening drive including a 22yard touchdown connection with Chris Thompson It was the first of three touchdown passes from Cousins on the evening as he also found tight end Vernon Davis and Josh Doctson for scores In total Cousins finished the night 25of30 for 365 yards with three touchdowns to zero interceptions and a quarterback rating of 1507 It was the fourth time in the last three seasons that Cousins has passes for at least 350 yards and three touchdowns and zero interceptions tied for the secondmost in the NFL during that span He was very precise and he anticipated some great throws said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden He really was very accurate and had great anticipation and thats a great combination for a quarterback thats for sure He saw the field He saw the coverages and then anticipated throws and was accurate And he had time to do that Your quarterback is only as good as your protection and the protection was sound And then the receivers have to finish plays for him and make plays for him and get open in mantoman They did that for him Cousins touchdown pass to Doctson was the secondyear wide receivers first catch of the season as he went up over former Redskins cornerback David Amerson to haul in the quarterbacks throw Despite Cousins first target being Terrelle Pryor Sr Doctson was the receiver the Pro Bowl quarterback threw it to for the touchdown I looked back over to Josh and David Amerson was getting deep as well but I do like Joshs ball skills and his ability to catch the ball up in the air and I thought you know what Im going to give him a chance they have been asking me to give him that chance and lets give it to him Cousins said It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Thats why this game is so tough This is the fourth time that Cousins has been named NFC Offensive Player of the Week joining Art Monk five and Mark Rypien four as the only players in franchise history to earn the award this many times', 'LOUDOUN COUNTY Va The National Football League announced today that Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins has been named the

him arguably the happiest kid on earth in that moment Heres the entire Facebook post from user Joey Snapp Today I witnessed one of the most amazing acts of kindness Ive ever witnessed I was in Gamestop and a child walked in around 11 years old talking about how his birthday was coming up and hes wanted an Xbox One for a few years but his parents couldnt afford it Another customer overheard this and walked up and asked the child what the issue was The child explained again that he wanted an Xbox for the last few years for his birthday and his parents couldnt afford it These two gentlemen told the kid they wanted to buy him an Xbox for his birthday and to go out and get his mom and make sure it was ok The kid in shock went and told his mother and this mother came into the store wondering who wanted to buy their kid an Xbox The mom walks in and the one guy says Maam my name is Keith Marshall and this is Rob Kelley and we play for the Washington Redskins and we would love to buy your son an Xbox One for his birthday My jaw hit the floor watching this So they buy him the Xbox and a game and they take pictures with the child and go on about their day I didnt even know what

questions submitted on Twitter about the Redskins roster and more as the team prepares for a Week 4 matchup with the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium AyeCoop asks Do you think Montae will start the rest of the season at Strong Safety HailMail While DJ Swearinger has settled into a leadership role as a defensive captain and starting free safety the Redskins have alternated reps at strong safety so far between Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett Everett started Washingtons games against the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders respectively while Nicholson was alongside Swearinger in the Redskins Week 2 victory over the Los Angeles Rams Even though Nicholson didnt start against the Raiders he appeared on 43 on the defenses 51 snaps This sort of rotation will likely continue at least for now as Redskins head coach Jay Gruden tries to play to both young safeties strengths I think Montae covers a lot of ground Hes very long and very fast and Montae is a good hitter too Deshazor is still doing a good job at safety and on special teams Gruden said Both of them are good football players and we plan to use them both I think theyre both going to help us Nicholson of course is coming off the best game of his young career He recorded an interception off Derek Carr but his production went well past the stat sheet He showed an ability to cover across the field and even laid a big hit on veteran wide receiver Michael Crabtree who was coming off a threetouchdown performance the week prior but was held to just one catch against Washington It is possible Nicholson will eventually take over the role entirely as the season progresses especially if hes able to string together more performances like his one against the Raiders Gruden even said Nicholson 21 years old and Swearinger 26 years old have the potential to be a great tandem As a rookie to come in and play as well as hes doing I tip my hat to him Swearinger said I continue to stay on him continue to get the chemistry going with me and him but hes playing amazing hes only going to keep getting better Hes a rookie man and still ripe behind the ears So hes still going to get better going to keep getting better but a great

Oakland including just 18 from Marshawn Lynch The unit also put Carr and Co into unfavorable situations on third downs as the Redskins stopped all 11 of the Raiders third down plays on the evening This week though Washington faces breakout rookie Kareem Hunt who was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month and NFL Rookie of the Month In just three games so far Hunt has rushed for 401 yards on 47 carries along with nine receptions for 137 yards Additionally he has scored six touchdowns in his first three NFL games the most through three games by a rookie in 37 years What makes Hunt so lethal is his ability to break off runs into lengthy touchdowns In each of Kansas Citys first three games the Toledo product has a touchdown of at least 50 yards Washington meanwhile currently ranks second against the run in the NFL allowing just a little more than 62 rushing yards per contest The unit is also one of eight teams to have yet to give up a 20plusyard run Linebacker Zach Brown who is currently second in the NFL in tackles noted that in order for the Redskins to slow Lynch the defense needed to be sound in tackling That will be the case this week as well especially against a young back riding so high right now Its a major emphasis for us since OTAs its a major emphasis in training camp and its a major emphasis during the week good fundamentally sound tackling and pursuit to the football Gruden said So hats off to the guys for executing the plan and playing well', 'If one person knows about elite quarterback play its Pro Football Hall of Famer Kurt Warner In Warners weekly

365 yards and three touchdowns With an 833 completion percentage and no interceptions Cousins earned a quarterback rating of 1507 his highest since 2015 Hes showed why hes gotten two straight

starts With the swing tackle sidelined the Redskins will look to TJ Clemmings to serve in a backup role behind Williams and Morgan Moses He played a lot at Minnesota two years at Minnesota played some tackle and guard so hes got some experience which is good said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Now its just making sure hes up to speed with our terminology and our protection calls and our runs Thats the key Buts hes a good athlete and obviously its good to have that type of experience in NFL games to be a third guy Clemmings was claimed off waivers earlier this month following his departure from

KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Jay Gruden and Greg Manuskys press conferences at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Josh Doctson s catch against the Raiders indicated the progress hes made practicing on a consistent basis It was a welcome sight Last years firstround draft pick Josh Doctson leapt over cornerback David Amerson and collected a jump ball from Kirk Cousins rolling his way into the end zone for a 52yard score and his first catch of the season The connection offered hope for many fans eager to see the talent they had been promised which was sidelined for the majority of last season and this preseason The catch on Sunday night Gruden said will help to establish more trust between the pairing as will another week of consistent practice with the full squad We have seen that in practice Gruden said of hi acrobatic skills It was good to see it in a game finally Now it is a matter of continuing to work on his route tree We know he can run a goball now we have got to work on his other stuff and the timing He has shown that he can do everything I think it is just a matter of putting day after day together and game after game together He is on the right track without a doubt We are excited to get him more reps and more balls 2 DJ Swearinger brings attitude and leadership to a defense that played one of its best games in history last week Of the many offseason moves and roster changes the Redskins have undergone none might be as important as the signing of safety DJ Swearinger who has seamlessly taken over as the teams vocal leader and defensive captain Hes just a fiery guy a guy that knows football across the board and I love that Manusky said I love his spirit and he gets guys around him to rally behind him and hes taking us where we need to be Were not there right now but were getting there His natural ability to lead a diverse group of players has paid dividends on the field operating as the eyes and ears of the defense and translating his intelligence to the whole unit In fact hes made it a priority to host two defensive meetings each week for the entire unit going over game plans and helping every level understand how the other will be functioning Its gone a long way so far Its one thing being a vocal guy but you have to back it up with production and sound play and know what you are talking about Gruden said Ive had guys before that are talkers that dont know what they are doing but he brings both He brings an edge to him that rubs off on people Not to say we didnt have that before but it is just an added dimension with him being here He also has a great knowledge of our system already and he can communicate that well with the other safeties young safeties the linebackers and what have you and the corners Communication is key on defense 3 The defense must swarm to Kareem Hunt to limit his production this Monday An immoveable object will meet an unstoppable force this Monday night or something close to that The Redskins defense is allowing just 623 rushing yards per game good for second best in the league while the Chiefs boast rookie running back Kareem Hunt who leads the league in rushing yards with 401 and scrimmage yards with 538 I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times You know No 10 Tyreek Hill in the backfield and No 13 DeAnthony Thomas in the backfield two fast guys that can really split you down the middle and also running the ball They are two effective guys that can run to the edge The challenge for the Redskins will also be staying on their keys and not getting duped on misdirection and deceptive formations the Chiefs like to show I think he has great vision number one Gruden said of Hunt I mentioned the contact balance that he has and obviously he has got the speed to run through holes He has done very good They have a great scheme over there They keep you offbalance They have got the zone reads going They have got the jet sweeps They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football 4 The defensive unit is starting to gel with increased time playing together With so many new parts needing to sync together its been an impressive beginning to the season for the Redskins defense which has in consecutive weeks limited opponents run games and played the brand of aggressive football fans have waited to see for some time Gruden noted that aiding this transition of new parts including Swearinger linebacker Zach Brown and defensive linemen Stacy McGee and Terrell McClain is the experience they all brought with them These guys have played a lot of football Gruden said It is just a matter of getting together with the terminology and playing well with your teammates What drew us to those guys Jonathan Allen obviously was their work ethic how hard they played They all seemed like smart guys and they fit in well Manusky has seen steady improvement the more they have played in games together expecting their unity to grow over the coming weeks Its great to get a lot of reps of seeing these guys playing together Manusky said Sometimes when youre coming out of the preseason and stuff some guys get 10 reps 15 reps or 20 reps its hard to get a good judge on what they can do and what they cant do Overall weve been pretty successful in the last couple of weeks From the players perspective theyre doing a good job I think theyre building camaraderie amongst themselves and were playing together and good things happen 5 Injured players are on the mend Washington received a handful of injuries following the Rams game that prevented a few starters from playing against Oakland After an extra day of rest this week everyone but for tackle Ty Nsekhe who received core muscle surgery on Tuesday was back at practice and there is more optimism surrounding many of their returns While limited in practice Thursday running back Rob Kelly tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Mason Foster all participated in individual drills Gruden isnt exactly sure the prognosis for them yet but their practicing is a positive sign We will see Gruden said when it came to Reed He felt better today did more team stuff today But we will have to wait and see So I dont know Gruden did also mention that defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis sustained a rotator cuff injury during the Raiders game Gruden is confident he should be able to play on Monday but Anthony

setting a tone that is rubbing off on some of the teams younger players Its called the Get Right Meeting Many Redskins defensive players gather weekly at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va or at a teammate like Josh Norman s house on an off day to watch a bit of extra film and take pointers from leaders like Norman or safety DJ Swearinger The purpose is selfexplanatory The Get Right Meeting is just to get right rookie safety Montae Nicholson said Sunday after Washingtons win against the Raiders Last weeks Get Right Meeting featured some extra motivating from Norman and Swearinger both of whom were irked by the national praise being heaped on the Raiders the assumption that the Redskins had no chance and some of the trash talking from Oaklands star players It certainly didnt hurt as the Redskins put together one of their best performances on defense in a long time on Sunday Night Football Nicholson in particular was one of the standouts His highlight play came early when he intercepted Raiders quarterback Derek Carrs first pass of the evening Nicholson played 43 of 51 defensive snaps alongside Swearinger with Deshazor Everett getting the other eight Everett was the starter but the Redskins have begun using Nicholson as their main strong safety trusting him in a multitude of situations I think Montae really has been impressive there is no doubt about it Redskins coach Jay Gruden said Monday You just look at his stature coming out of the tunnel I mean he looks the part He is physical He is big He can run I just cant say enough about what DJ Swearinger means to Montae As far as communication giving him the confidence where he can play fast and free Those two together are just a great tandem A week before in Los Angeles Nicholson was used in nickel packages That meant he was on the field the majority of the time but still in a specific role In just a week it seemed that Nicholson gained enough trust from the coaching staff to line up in multiple spots in multiple packages That seems like a lot to ask for a rookie but Nicholson said it actually helps him play freely Most people would think Oh youve got to learn all of this stuff but no instead of sitting back there and waiting in the post moving me around has given me confidence that they trust me enough to move me around and do these multiple things Nicholson said And I couldnt be more grateful I couldnt be more appreciative Its not just the coaching staff Nicholson appreciates Having Swearinger around to remind him what area of the field hes responsible for or what a particular players tendencies are minimizes mistakes Obviously he is a rookie and playing safety there is so much change Theres change of strengths theres change of calls that happen fast theres no huddles and you have got to get lined up And thats why I say playing along DJ Swearinger has really made the transition smooth for Montae Gruden said I think if we had another young safety back there I dont know if he would be as productive quite frankly But with DJ back there leading the way communicating talking has made life a lot easier for Montae I think Montaes success is really dependent on DJ and then once he gets more reps he wont need DJ as much but he needs him now Whether its at the Get Right Meeting via text throughout the week or just before an opposing center snaps the ball to the quarterback Swearinger takes it upon himself to offer younger players pointers Hed done that with Sua Cravens during the offseason and training camp but with Cravens now on reserve for the year hes doing so with Everett and Nicholson I emphasize all the small things Sort of the small things that coaches dont cover that experience has to give you Swearinger said Thats what I try to give them Theyre growing Shazor hes doing great Montae is doing great Those guys Im a young guy but I feel like Im an old guy with these young guys I feel like a proud big bro especially with Montae and Shazor but Im going to stay on those guys and theyre going to continue to get better Read more Washington Redskins coverage in The Washington Times', 'A morning roundup of

TCU product wasnt targeted in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and was located just once by quarterback Kirk Cousins against the Los Angeles Rams His touchdown reception one in which

so confident said Redskins cornerback Josh Norman His approach to the game and practices he makes all those plays in practice that you all saw down on the field in the game For us we see it in the game its like You do it out here in practice and lo and behold his time came and his shot was there He made the most of it To see him capture that moment and come in here like that I know it was a big big sigh of relief for him with those things off his shoulders Now we actually see that come to fruition what he put in practice and its a beautiful thing to see Everybody was rooting for him and Im glad that he could come in and make a play like that for the team Stephen Czarda HUNT DOWN KAREEM Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt was virtually a noname heading into Week 1 After losing original starter Spencer Ware before the opening game against the New England Patriots the Chiefs called upon their thirdround pick Hunt fumbled his first handoff but made few errors from then on Now Hunt is playing like a veteran in his prime Hes the leagues leading rusher through three games with 401 yards 113 more than his secondplace competitor Dalvin Cook He has yet to fumble since Week 1 and has not averaged below five yards a carry in any of his games He also has at least one run of 50 or more yards in every game this season and has scored at least one touchdown in each contest I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times Hunt also provides an added dimension to Kansas Citys already explosive offense With so much productivity in the ground game Chiefs head coach Andy Reid can open up the passing game for quarterback Alex Smith Gruden said these different offensive schemes can put a defense on its heels They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football Gruden said Coach Reid does an excellent job with his offense and disguising his intent using a lot of different guys to touch the ball a lot of skill Washington will have to rely on its defensive playmakers like cornerback Josh Norman and linebacker Zach Brown to try and bottle up Hunt before he breaks off another 50yard run With linebacker Mason Foster still nursing an injury Hunt may look to the middle of the field for his next big play Brandon Hill COOLING OFF ALEX SMITH Alex Smith was drafted No 1overall by San Francisco in 2005 and has since endured a lengthy career in the NFL starting 75 games for the 49ers before his arrival in Kansas City more than four years ago Despite the vast experience he boasts Smith might be playing better now than he ever has in his career As it stands heading into Week 4 the 33yearold tops the league in passer rating completion percentage and game winning drives among other categories He has generally played mistakefree football as well passing for seven touchdowns and no interceptions He has done this all while leading the NFLs thirdbest offense in terms of yards per game While much of the national attention has been paid to Hunt and explosive wide receiver Tyreek Hill Smith is a big reason why the Chiefs have jumped out to a 30 record Despite the changes hes seen in efficiency and production lately he has stuck to one tactic that has helped him throughout his NFL career staying mobile He is one of those guys that can avoid trouble and hurt you with his legs Gruden said of Smith You can have everybody covered downfield but he can rush for the first downs on thirdandeight thirdand10 whatever it is Smiths hot start will be put to the test on Monday night however as he goes up against a Redskins defense that is coming off a fantastic performance against the Raiders The unit was able to force four sacks two fumbles and two interceptions Jay Cannon SHOW EM SUNDAY WAS NO FLUKE Redskins safety DJ Swearinger took all of the talk about the Raiders last week personally Yes Oakland was entering the game with a 20 record and fresh off a 124 season last year But almost no one outside of the Redskins was giving the team much of a chance Then the game happened and it was a onesided blowout courtesy of a dominating defensive performance Washington hadnt experienced in 25 years When I had the meeting on Tuesday I said nobodys going to give us a chance to win Swearinger said following the 2710 victory The NFL wants the Oakland Raiders to come in Washington and beat up on the Washington Redskins and as a defense were not going to let that happen Regardless of what the offense and special teams do we control the game if they dont score they dont win and whichever the offense how many yards they put up tonight rushing yards passing yards I mean I think our defense stood up and really made a statement on the No 1 offense in the league While it was an impressive outing this weeks matchup may be even tougher Not only are the Chiefs one of just two remaining unbeaten teams the Redskins have to play in Arrowhead Stadium The Redskins will be seeking backtoback road victories on Monday Night Football for the first time since 2005 and 2007 while pushing their prime time record this year to 20 You can never really get too comfortable Foster said Its the NFL everybody gets paid everybodys a playmaker so any game on a national stage like this

even come within 100 yards of breaking Dickersons yardage record But with the 2017 season comes a new challenger to the infamous Los Angeles Rams rusher Kareem Hunt the great question mark prior to Week 1 has exploded onto the scene for the Kansas City Chiefs Hunt spent four years in college as the Toledo Rockets featured back amassing 5500 yards and 45 touchdowns Hunt helped lead the Rockets to four straight winning seasons Drafted 86thoverall in the third round Hunt was not expected to start for Kansas City right away The Chiefs and Jamaal Charles split ways after the 2016 season and Spencer Ware was expected to carry the load However Ware went down with a torn PCL and LCL during the preseason leaving a gaping hole in Kansas Citys depth chart Hunt stepped into the role left by Ware and things could not have started worse In Week 1 Hunt fumbled his first snap against the New England Patriots a ball the defense would recover It looked like the rookie was in for a rough ride But Hunt kept with it finding seams in the defensive line and breaking off large chunks of yardage Before the Patriots could gather themselves Kansas City had cruised to a 4227 victory and Hunt had 148 yards and 3 total touchdowns under his belt Hunts rampage on the NFL is far from over Through three games Hunt has averaged 85 yards a carry and has a touchdown in each matchup He also has a run of at least 50 yards in every game this season With this kind of pace Hunt could be looking at a 2000yard or more season That would shatter Dickersons record and begin Hunts career as the NFLs most

on the season threw two against the Redskins secondary Hunt is not the only playmaker on the Chiefs offense Wide receiver Tyreek Hill is having a career year with 253 yards and two touchdowns Kansas City likes to use Hill in a variety of schemes Gruden said this diversity can confuse a defense and make it difficult to know which player to focus on Despite his abilities to break off big runs Redskins safety DJ Swearinger is confident the defense which held Oakland Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch to just 18 yards last week will be ready for Hunt Hes definitely a tough task Swearinger said He puts his foot down in the ground and gets vertical he breaks tackles Hes an allaround back catches the ball out of the backfield so we definitely have our hands full with him hes definitely

Lanier II No 79 T Ty Nsekhe No 83 WR Brian Quick', 'When the Redskins signed linebacker Zach Brown in the offseason one of his first promises to the secondary was that it wouldnt need to worry about tackling So far thats been the case When head coach Jay Gruden thinks of linebacker Zach Brown one play comes to mind that exemplifies the impact hes had on the Redskins through three games Early in the second quarter during the teams victory over the Rams quarterback Jared Goff found tight end Gerald Everett wide open down the right sideline and a 75yard touchdown looked inevitable But sprinting at full capacity and catching up to him was Brown who made a tackle just six yards before the goal line His speed shows up a lot Gruden said Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in gameday when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed But that play was also indicative of a promise that Brown made to his defensive backs when he was signed in the offseason Second in the league in tackles last season 149 and second again entering Week 4 with 33 Browns biggest attribute has been bringing players to the ground letting his corners and safeties focus primarily on coverage duties On that neartouchdown catch Brown knew that safety Deshazor Everett could have also tackled the Rams tight end before the goal line but wanted to clean up the mess himself In my mind I want to protect my corners and the secondary Brown said I dont want nobody picking on them nobody trying to make dumb tackles Were going to tackle were going to defeat the block that you got coming for us and were going to go get them Me and Mason Foster and the front seven will make sure you dont have to tackle no running back he added A lot of people get hurt tackling a running back Its one of the many reasons why cornerback Josh Norman smiling at his recent locker room session with the media said of Brown he makes the job a whole lot easier and then summed up his thoughts Boy I love Zach Brown Someone else sharing that sentiment and reaping the rewards of Browns tackling abilities is cornerback Bashaud Breeland who sits next to Brown in the locker room and likes to share conversation about their nearby hometowns in South Carolina Hes already noticed a difference in Browns speed letting him play observer to opposing running backs being tackled Through three games Breeland has just eight tackles After two games last season before he injured himself early against the Giants Breeland had already collected 19 tackles Last year around this time I probably had around 20some tackles Breeland said Now I really dont have to worry about the tackling If I do he kind of beats me to him or he assists me Hes all of over the field Thats a great addition to the team Hes making it easy for us While safety DJ Swearinger has already been anointed the vocal leader of the defense Brown has earned a similar leadership role for his play on the field and during times of crisis Take last Sundays game against the Raiders for example when defensive coordinator Greg Manuskys communication system failed during several plays Brown stepped in to make the calls without it They made a call and they played it Manusky said So whatever the call was that Zach Brown made in the middle we played it It was an indication of the trust players have in Brown as well as the inside linebackers intelligence and readiness to step up when needed If youre the other linebacker on the field youre going to know the calls you have to know the calls make sure you know where everybodys supposed to be because you never know Brown said When Mason Foster went down I had to call the calls so you just have to know Because somebody might not know what theyre supposed to do so youve got to tell them youve got to be able to communicate with them on defense and its trust too They trust me to make the call Brown has garnered that trust by doing the little things he said showing up on time to meetings correcting mistakes on the field and communicating constantly about miscues that can be fastened up Browns goal one he stated during OTAs is to be the defensive MVP this season an award often given to those with high tackle totals But individual statistics can sometimes be misleading as Brown hopes them to be for the remainder of the season Good defenses get around 55 plays so if you get around 55 plays youre not going to have as many tackles Brown said But your defense is going to be that good So for us as a defense were trying to cut down our plays because the more you cut down your pays the more youre off the field So thats a big goal of ours Still the tackles he does acquire will continue to make a difference keeping the secondary out of harms way as the Redskins keep building on their defensive cohesiveness', 'EASY TWEET Redskins RedskinsCR kick off National Breast Cancer Awareness Month with limited edition 2017 BCA Tshirt and charity ride on Oct7 LOUDOUN COUNTY Va The

injury His return is also questionable On the Chiefs next drive the defense continued to hold strong Cornerbacks Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland laid backtoback big hits on Kansas Citys skill players

the Chiefs one of several injuries the secondary managed through Monday night On a night that saw the majority of the Redskins secondary needing medical attention on the sideline the team was dealt a tough blow when it was announced that cornerback Josh Norman had sustained a rib fracture following their 2920 loss to the Chiefs For Norman who exited the field after the twominute warning in the second quarter when he was injured tackling Kansas City wide receiver Chris Conley on a 21yard pass play the timetable for his return to the field is undetermined Norman didnt return to the game after getting XRays in the locker room before halftime You know going in for the ball getting the tackle and I dont know landed awkwardly falling on the heel the heel of his shoe said Norman who had pain as he breathed It got me on the side I came in and got Xrays and saw one of my ribs had something done to it I wanted to come back out but the team specialist thought it was best if I stay outits a long season but we just want to be cautious and be aware and do their job and not have me go out there and do anything more on the issue Cornerback Quinton Dunbar took over Normans responsibilities for the rest of the game logging four tackles and playing good coverage in his absence He too left for a brief period with some cramping bringing out rookie Fabian Moreau in his place but returned to finish out the game I mean it definitely was tough Dunbar said We got two heavyweight teams going at it battling back and forth bodies getting fatigued That happens thats part of the game For Norman and the Redskins the bye week comes at a helpful time giving a handful of players an opportunity to rest and recover after a gritty performance in which nearly the entire depth chart was used to fill voids left by injuries throughout the game It came at a good time a time in which we needed it Norman said of the bye A lot of us are banged up right now Were going to go back and lick our wounds come back out here in a week and try to get a W We came out here for it so its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that Norman the ultimate competitor that he is struggled to watch from the sidelines as the defense relied on backups especially considering five different defensive backs left the game at various points at Arrowhead Stadium Among the other notable injuries included safety Montae Nicholson who was diagnosed with an AC Joint sprain Cornerback Kendall Fuller also had to leave the game briefly in the fourth quarter after getting kicked unintentionally near his forehead which took his helmet off in the process The mixing and matching managed to keep the Chiefs at bay for most of the second half even as they ate up plenty of clock on some long drives that helped to exhaust the defense Norman like most of his teammates couldnt help but watch the tense ending to the game without being able to control the outcome The Redskins will hope that isnt the case for too long Like I said I was in here watching It sucks man Norman said You want to do something You want to do something more and its just a mortal body it just doesnt give you what you need It doesnt sustain you and going out there and helping those guys You try to fight through you try to numb the pain by blocking it out I wanted to go so bad just release me man I cant really do anything about that The higher up youve just got to take in what they say Its a long season Its a long season but for me when my juices get amped up and I get going I want to go regardless Fell a little short in doing that today', 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 4 game against the Kansas City Chiefs that took place at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City Mo 1 Dealing win injuries and a onesided battle in time of possession the Redskins showed resiliency against the Chiefs Entering Monday nights game as the only remaining unbeaten in the NFL and playing in front of their own fans the Chiefs were considered favorites to score a victory But in the opening frame it was the Redskins who looked ready to seize a big victory The offenses first drive was capped by a 44yard touchdown connection between Kirk Cousins and Terrelle Pryor Sr while the defense forced a threeandout Washington would eventually climb out to a 100 lead before the Chiefs stormed back in the second half as they got the best of a Redskins defense that was wounded They also dominated time of possession keeping the ball in their hands for more than 37 minutes I feel like its a hard fought game at a great stadium great atmosphere it was crazy man we just got to make more plays so we win said linebacker Mason Foster Thats what it comes down to While the effort showed that Washington has the depth to compete with any team in the NFL losing such a close battle is tough Im an ultimate competitor but I feel like this game shows a lot about this team that we got a pretty darn good football team said cornerback Quinton Dunbar And it shows where were at and it shows that if we keep battling keep believing in each other keep believing in the coaches and the gameplan when we get back off this bye its going to be a special 12 weeks Despite falling in the closing seconds after the Chiefs nailed a field goal with eight seconds left Pryor believes the Redskins proved they are fighters We battled a team thats pretty darn good on paper Pryor said When they came in here theyre 40 for a reason obviously We had a lot of opportunities We led in the game a long time then we came back and punched them after they hit us back in the mouth and we punched them back We just needed to score a touchdown A field goal doesnt win games Touchdowns do Its unfortunate that we couldnt get that first down late in the red zone and that was the last time we saw the ball really 2 Headlined by Josh Norman s rib injury the defense had to go deep into their rotations against one of the leagues most explosive offenses Norman did not play at all in the second half of Mondays 2920 loss to the Chiefs as the cornerback suffered a rib injury that could sideline him for some time But the former AllPro wasnt the only defensive player that needed attention from the teams training staff as Dubar safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett and even Foster missed some plays in a second half in which Kansas City controlled the ball a majority of the time For Norman his loss was especially difficult on the defense as he was setting a tempo against Kansas Citys offense On one play prior to his exit Norman laid a big hit on Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce I came in and got Xrays and saw one of my ribs had something done to it Norman said I wanted to come back out but the team specialist thought it was best if I stay out I said I was but its a long season We just want to be cautious With the defense wanting to be more physical this season Foster admitted that sometimes players are going to get a little banged up But the younger players provided a glimpse of their potential while instilling trust that they can match the starters intensity on the field When youve got guys on this defense playing as hard as they do flying around playing special teams playing their heart out every single snap you are going to see guys get hurt and nicked up Foster said But thats why the other guys practice I mean everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how defensive coordinator Greg Manusky coaches it so everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 3 Kirk Cousins continued his string of solid performances in front of a national stage In Washingtons season opening loss to Philadelphia Cousins fumbled twice including one that sealed the Redskins fate along with throwing an untimely fourth quarter interception in the red zone But in recent weeks the Michigan State product has bounced back While Monday wasnt his most prolific game Cousins played mistakefree football He finished the night completing 14of24 passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns He also registered a passer rating of 1167 I think in this league the 16week season is a grind and its not for the faint of heart Cousins said Youve got to be physically emotionally and mentally tough Nobody feels sorry for you if you arent You just try to stay the course and be really toughminded and whatever gets thrown at you just take it in stride Cousins was also able to showcase his mobility particularly on a late gametying field goal drive While the Chiefs were unable to sack the quarterback on the night they did flush him out of the pocket a few times Cousins however took advantage of some open running lanes as he carried the ball three different times for 33 yards When teams play man coverage thats when you really have an opportunity to run because guys are chasing their man and they dont have eyes on you Cousins said They did a good job of taking guys away and doubling some people and really all I had was to run and I think thats an area of my game that I can use more I think Its there for the taking if I get through a progression and dont find anything and take off and run instead of throw it away Cousins also came close to throwing a gamewinning touchdown on the drive as he lofted a beautiful ball to wide receiver Josh Doctson but the pair was unable to connect for a touchdown in consecutive weeks We just didnt hit that third down play Cousins said Well go back and look at a couple of other plays throughout the game that couldve made a big difference but allinall we played well I was pleased there were so few penalties on offense We played pretty mistakefree I think in a lot of ways showed some maturity from that standpoint Tough one to lose It felt like we had a chance there and didnt get it done 4 Vernon Davis continues to show that he has a lot left in the tanks One of the reasons why the Redskins had just four offensive plays in the third quarter was due to a 69yard reception by Davis After the Chiefs jumped out to their first lead of the game at 1410 midway through the third quarter Cousins found Davis open on the right side of the field While the initial reception would have easily netted the Redskins a new set of downs Davis continued to defy Father Time as the 33yearold tight end weaved in and out of the Chiefs defense for the nearly 70plusyard gain Not only was the reception Davis longest since a 73yard catch on Jan 3 2010 it moved him into the top 10 alltime in NFL history in receiving yards among tight ends Davis now has eight catches for 120 yards in the last three games We call him el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Cousins said We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 5 The bye week comes at the perfect time With the Redskins battling injuries on both sides of the ball the players will extra time to heal their wounds before returning to game action on Sunday Oct 15 against the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md We get a chance to rest get some treatment and really ice up and get ready to make a big run said Foster who suffered a dislocated shoulder in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Rams So I think its perfect timing we know what were capable of so we got to get it corrected and focus on that and then come back and just let it get on a roll try to tag them together so its coming at the perfect time Norman agreed with Foster as the cornerback hopes to not miss any time with his rib injury A lot of us are banged up right now Norman said Were going to go back and lick our wounds come back out here in a week and try to get a W We came out here for it so its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that', 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was a threeplay 75yard scoring drive finished off by a Ryan Grant threeyard touchdown catch that gave the Redskins the lead After a 10play 79yard scoring drive by the Kansas City Chiefs to open up the second half one that would put them ahead for the first time of the night the Redskins responded rapidly with a big pass play Starting from their own 25yard line the Redskins helped quiet a crowd that had gained momentum with the help of tight end Vernon Davis who caught a 69yard pass that came about largely because of his speed and patience Quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a perfect pass to Davis open down the right seam and then the tight end began using his vision waiting for blocks ahead of him to scamper around cutting to his left and running down to the Kansas City sixyard line The pass play put Davis in 10th alltime in receiving yards among tight ends in NFL history We call him el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Cousins said of Davis We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19 year old Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with Running back Samaje Perine carried the ball up the middle for three yards and then the Redskins made it count Cousins found wide receiver Ryan Grant on a shallow crossing route in the end zone with Grant making an impressive grab It was his second touchdown of the season snagging it above cornerback Marcus Peters and giving Washington the lead back just like that The drive took just one minute and 38 seconds', 'The Redskins on Tuesday added two offensive players to the practice squad in former Wisconsin

time for the Redskins many of whom were injured Monday night but especially for Cousins who will have a full week of paternity leave as he captions in his latest Instagram post Its been a great experience because Julies just been so positive all the way through it Cousins said on Saturday Shes been so disciplined and really just has been a joy through the whole nine months and the actual labor and delivery was no different She was a joy through it and just another reminder that I married up That was a life goal of mine to marry up and I did that I think this whole process the last

scarf is taking to his new brother just fine', 'Only 72 hours after welcoming his new son into the world Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins came one pass away from upsetting the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday Night Football Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins had a lot on his mind Monday night Just two days after his son Cooper was born Cousins traveled west to play in a primetime game against the Kansas City Chiefs Cousins like any other new father would have been understandably distracted with the arrival his first child However the veteran passer focused his attention on football for a few hours and put on a performance that nearly earned the Redskins a victory against the last unbeaten team in the NFL I think in this league the 16week season is a grind and its not for the faint of heart Youve got to be physically emotionally and mentally tough Cousins said I feel very blessed very fortunate to be in the position I am in for so many different reasons A thirddown incompletion on Washingtons last drive forced the Redskins to kick a field goal Kansas City later came back with a lastsecond kick of their own preserving their unbeaten record Although the final series stalled Washingtons offense led by Cousins had been hot from the start During the Redskins first drive Cousins hit wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr on a 44yard bomb Pryor hauled in the pass in the end zone and put Washington up early For the first half the entire Redskins offense played with tenacity Cousins looked on point with most of his passes He finished the game with 220 yards through the air and two touchdowns while completing 58 percent of his throws However Washingtons quick start was soon marred by injuries Left tackle Trent Williams went down with a knee injury during the second quarter leaving thirdstring TJ Clemmings to fill in for four plays Running back Rob Kelley also headed to the sideline with an ankle injury The Chiefs offense meanwhile started to click as the first half drew to a close and Kansas City inched back from an early 10point deficit coming within three as the teams left for the locker rooms Once quarterback Alex Smith put his team up 1410 moments into the third quarter Cousin began spreading the ball around trying to keep the Washington offense from losing tempo Seven players caught passes from Cousins including 33year old tight end Vernon Davis on Washingtons first drive of the third quarter Cousins backed up on his own 25yardline floated the ball over two Kansas City defenders Davis made the catch at midfield and used the agility of a much younger man to shift his way to the Chiefs 5yard line Ryan Grant hauled in a Cousins touchdown pass not long after giving the Redskins their final lead of the game Kirk did some great things competing at the end and using his legs when he had to said head coach Jay Gruden The guys competed man I am happy the way they competed We unfortunately didnt finish today After Kansas City took the lead with two field goals Cousins tried a new strategy to get the team down the field After checking for open receivers Cousin tucked the ball and ran on multiple occasions Instead of sprinting toward the sideline he often took off in the middle of the field lowering his shoulder and fighting for extra yardage He finished the game as the teams leading rusher with 38 yards on seven carries When teams play man coverage thats when you really have an opportunity to run because guys are chasing their man and they dont have eyes on you Cousins said They did a good job of taking guys away and doubling some people and really all I had was to run and I think thats an area of my game that I can use more I think Cousins found Josh Doctson in the end zone for what would have been a gamewinning touchdown but the secondyear receiver could not hold onto the ball once he hit the ground Cousins lamented Washingtons one weakness during the game converting only four out of 11 third downs However he said there would be plenty of time to address that during the teams upcoming bye week I like our team I think we are better than people probably thought we would be at the beginning of the season Cousins said Were excited about the group of guys we have We just have to stay together Hopefully stay as healthy as we can and continue to play mature smart football', 'A morning roundup of what the

by its style of play and aiming to get healthy Last week cornerback Josh Norman was explicit when he said that there were no moral victories in football adding that either you win or you lose At the time preparing for an undefeated team on Monday Night Football his comments felt like the right mindset for the Redskins to take But after a 2920 loss to the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with the game in the Redskins control for most of the night despite a handful of injuries that tested nearly everyone on the roster and with the opportunity for victory as close as one dropped pass an addendum could have been made to Normans comments Yes the Redskins finished the first quarter of their season at 22 knowing that both of their losses could have been avoided if not for some key mistakes at inopportune times But as the team enters its Bye Week coming at an ideal time to help heal numerous injuries it also feels encouraged and confident in the way its handled a tough schedule of competitors With them being the best team in the league with us playing a hardfought game like we did and having the penalties that we did having the injuries that we had I think were a great team if we keep going at it we keep pushing we keep fighting together said safety DJ Swearinger of the Chiefs Then this team can really do something special but weve got to get healthy We cant beat ourselves weve got to play more disciplined and weve got play together Indeed even without a victory the Chiefs game exemplified the qualities that the Redskins have shown over the first four games of the season that their defense has made vast improvements with new personnel and better depth that Kirk Cousins and the offense is finding its rhythm with new parts on offense that they can play with the best of the league in primetime matchups Monday night also showed some of the ways theyre holding themselves back too The Redskins committed seven penalties many of which came during crucial third down stops that would have otherwise eliminated the Chiefs from scoring more points on subsequent plays Its the symptom of an aggressive and physical defense one that has mostly benefited the team and given Washington a new identity The Redskins have held opponents to 3142 yards per game and just 888 yards rushing per game both good for 11th in the league and especially impressive considering the offenses they have matched up against Their type of play also leads to more potential for injuries which occurred frequently Monday night When youve got guys on this defense playing as hard as they do flying around playing special teams playing their heart out every single snap you are going to see guys get hurt and knicked up but thats why the other guys practice linebacker Mason Foster said I mean everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how Greg Manusky coaches it so everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field Monday night demonstrated that With so much uncertainty regarding who would be available to play backups entered the game and played as proficiently as possible It was encouraging said left tackle Trent Williams who battled a knee sprain for most of the game Its optimistic to see guys not back down next man up I feel like it was next man up the whole game so a lot of people played that probably didnt expect to contribute and that just shows you the grit of this team I just kind of verified what I know about these guys and how hard they play really head coach Jay Gruden said Im glad people got to see it Unfortunately we didnt get the win but these guys have given me everything they had since OTAs have started Theyve got a great work ethic Theyve got a great demeanor about them They understand that this game with the people we have here theres going to be a lot of ups and downs in pro football and they have to handle adversity I think we have a group that can With some much needed rest awaiting them the Redskins have answered a lot of questions through four games but theyre not done answering more After two primetime matchups against premier opponents on an elevated stage they will look for a win at home against the 49ers to start the next quarter of the season with solid footing in preparation for the long haul ahead I think from our team psyche I think were going to enjoy our bye week get rested get healed up and I think were going to come back with vengeance and try to make this as good of a 12 weeks as we can quarterback

season', 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda provides five things weve learned about the Washington Redskins through the first four games Eagles Rams Raiders and Chiefs of the 2017 regular season 1 The defense is looking like a completely different unit this year One season after the Redskins finished 28 th in total defense the unit looks anew this season under Greg Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator in the offseason after spending the 2016 season as the teams outside linebackers coach Through the first four games of the season the Redskins rank 10 th in total defense allowing just a little more than 311 yards per contest Washington also ranks third in the NFL in total sacks 12 while allowing just 69 first downs Washingtons best defensive performance in 25 seasons came in a 2710 victory over the Oakland Raiders as the defense allowed just 128 yards the fewest yards allowed by Washington in a game since Oct 12 1992 They also didnt allow Oakland to convert on all 11 of their third down plays I think we played very strong in the middle of our defense said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Our defensive linemen did a great job being stout Our outside backers were stout in the running game and held them to minimal yards per carry and forced them to throw the ball in known passing situations enabled our rush to get home and our coverage was tight I think just all around the calls were sound the players executed we tackled extremely well we flew to the football didnt give up any big plays whatsoever other than the touchdown pass after the turnover I think when youre talking about a defense that played that well I think its impossible to just say This is why I think its because everybody who took part played well played hard played with great passion and energy and played smart This success is also coming with linebacker Trent Murphy and defensive lineman Phil Taylor both of whom were expected to be key rotational players sidelined for the year with injuries and the team having to quickly determine a new strong safety plan when Sua Cravens was placed on the ReserveLefft Squad list The units depth was tested against the Kansas City Chiefs as numerous players including cornerbacks Josh Norman and Quinton Dunbar along with safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett were all sidelined for certain periods of time with injury Everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how Manusky coaches it said linebacker Mason Foster who sealed Washingtons Week 2 victory over the Rams with a late interception So everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 2 Vernon Davis continues to be The Ageless One For most teams having their No 1 tight end limited would be troublesome But the Redskins arent like most teams in the NFL with the depth they have at the position With Jordan Reed has been slowed by various injuries so far this year Davis has stepped up in a big way for the offense After not being targeted in Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the 33yearold has caught eight passes for 160 yards 11 th most among tight ends and one touchdown His 20 yards per reception also leads all tight ends In the Redskins blowout victory over the Raiders Davis caught a 22yard touchdown pass in the second quarter Then against the Chiefs in Week 4 Davis caught two passes for 89 yards 69 of which came when Davis outran two defenders to initial catch the ball before weaving his way through traffic Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said Just out here at practice hes running around like a 20yearold kid Were going to have to try to dive into that but I know he has a great routine in the offseason during the season His diet is topnotch His workouts are on point Not to mention he prepares and hes just always got a smile on his face Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player Quarterback Kirk Cousins added that Davis has earned the nickname el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Cousins said Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 3 New faces have led the way for the defensive unit One of the reasons why the Redskins have seen such positive early returns on the defensive side of the ball is because of some of the players that were brought in this offseason Yes Ryan Kerrigan and Josh Norman continue to play at a high level Matt Ioannidis also looks like a completely different player this year too But the likes of DJ Swearinger Zach Brown and Jonathan Allen have made a difference After an offseason competition for the starting inside linebacker spots Brown earned the nod to be the No 1 Mo linebacker and he hasnt disappointed The 2016 Pro Bowler currently tops the NFL in tackles with 42 I think his speed really shows up on tape Gruden said Plays that for instance the Rams game when the kid broke a long run the tight end who ran a 45 at the combine or whatever he ran he got hawked down by Zach Brown and what the heck did Zach Brown run then So his speed shows up a lot Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in game day when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed Swearinger meanwhile is a vocal presence in the defensive backfield But his presence goes well beyond the lines Hes recently hosted a playersonly Get Right meeting to focus on corrections I emphasize all the small things Sort of the small things that coaches dont cover that experience has to give you Swearinger said Thats what I try to give them Theyre growing Shazor Deshazor Everett hes doing great Montae Nicholson is doing great Those guys Im a young guy but I feel like Im an old guy with these young guys I feel like a proud big bro especially with Montae and Shazor but Im going to stay on those guys and theyre going to continue to get better As for Allen Washingtons firstround pick in this years draft has been productive in the trenches He continues to lead the defensive lines rotation as he grows with every passing week Thats the beauty thats the most exciting thing about Jonathan He just hasnt scratched the surface of his own potential yet Gruden said He is just going to get better and better the more he sees and the more he plays 4 Chris Thompson has been one of the leagues breakout players so far Entering the season Gruden remained committed in his belief that Thompson is one of the best thirddown backs in the NFL Then the Redskins remained committed in their belief that Thompson should remain in Washington for a few more years as they signed him to a contract extension before the regular season opener Through the first four weeks of the season the 2013 fifthround pick has recorded 20 carries for 142 yards and two touchdowns along with 14 receptions for 235 yards and two receiving touchdowns Thompson is just one rushing yard off from leading Washington in both rushing and receiving I think the temptation early on was Man hes a little smallish Can he hold up How much can you give him the ball how much can you play him He was a big part of special teams But then when hes on the field hes so productive in every phase of the game said Redskins offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh Hes a good runner very good runner Hes got great explosion Hes excellent in running routes and catching the ball and hes a very good pass protector Against the Eagles in the opener Thompson recorded the Redskins first touchdown of the season when he caught a short pass and flipped it into a 29yard touchdown off a magical play The next week he logged two more touchdowns against the Rams before accumulating 188 yards from scrimmage against the Raiders While theres certainly a temptation to get Thompson more and more reps Gruden wants to keep his role one that hes excelling in defined Ive said before hes a very valuable guy in the role that hes in third down Gruden said Hes also one of our kick returners He does a lot of getting back on track calls on second downandlong and theres some firstdown plays that hes in But yes its important for us to keep him healthy Hes not a guy that I personally want to give him 30 carries a game He probably wants it but he probably wont get it 5 After one of his worst outings in the opener Cousins is starting to round into form again It was a game in which the Pro Bowl quarterback didnt look himself Coming off a season in which he threw for nearly 5000 yards Cousins struggled against the Eagles in Week 1 He completed only 23of40 passes for 240 yards with one touchdown to one interception The interception was one of three turnovers from Cousins as the quarterback skied an errant pass on a crucial third down throw Then minutes later the quarterback was stripped sack as he was trying to mount a gamewinning drive But in the three games since the opener Cousins has been nearly flawless Along with leading a successful gamewinning drive against the Rams Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts against the Raiders 25of35 for 365 yards with three touchdowns In total against the Rams Raiders and Chiefs Cousins is 57of81 for 764 yards with six touchdowns to no interceptions I think there is a lot to like really I think especially after the first game Gruden said He got a lot of pressure He was a little bit inaccurate the first game more so then he ever has been but a lot of that had to do with the pressure that Philly gave him People were in his face quite often I think he has improved dramatically Week 2 Week 3 and even against the Chiefs I was impressed that last drive He had a couple huge scrambles using his legs big runs to get us into a position to get a tying field goal or possibly win the game if Josh can hang on to the ball Kirk is playing well and he is getting us in position to win Thats all you can ask for at the end of the day I have been impressed with Kirk in the way he has come on after Week 1', 'In todays Rewarding

coach Joe Gibbs pressed on He called three pass plays in a row for the eventual Hall of Famer during a final fourth quarter drive The third pass was the recordsetter a 10yard throw from Mark Rypien

their division rivals and will have two trips to the West Coast before the seasons end The Washington Redskins had a grueling first quarter of the season Pro Football Reference ranked Washingtons fourgame slate as the toughest in the NFL The Los Angeles Rams Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs all sit atop their divisions The only Redskins opponent not leading their division would be the Oakland Raiders who recently lost Derek Carr to a multipleweek injury Luckily for Washington the remaining 12 games on the schedule rank among the easiest in the league right now according to FootballOutsiderscom with many teams posting records below 500 four games into the season Heres a look at whats ahead for the Redskins for the rest of the regular season Week 6 San Francisco 49ers 04 4 th place in NFC West Top Passer Brian Hoyer 858 yards 2 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Carlos Hyde 321 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Pierre Garon 20 receptions 285 yards 0 touchdowns The 49ers seemed to have an immediate upgrade at receiver after acquiring former Redskins starter PierreGaron in the offseason However Garons numbers do not quite match up to last years This is not at all aided by quarterback Brian Hoyers high interception total and inability to score in the red zone The offense has been outscored 4914 through the air The defense is an area that has exceeded expectations San Francisco has the sixthhighest rate of quarterback pressures through four weeks Week 7 Philadelphia Eagles 31 1 st place in NFC East Top Passer Carson Wentz 1058 yards 6 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher LeGarrette Blount 249 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Zach Ertz 26 receptions 326 yards 1 touchdown Quarterback Carson Wentz has refined his game after a bumpy rookie campaign He already has a third of the passing yards he accumulated last year After defeating the Redskins at FedExField in Week 1 snapping a fivegame losing streak against Washington the Eagles will have the comfort of a home crowd in the battle for the NFC East crown Tight end Zach Ertz may lead the team in receiving yards but new addition Alshon Jeffery gives the Eagles a legitimate deep threat at receiver Jeffery has 215 yards on 17 catches this season with two touchdowns Week 8 Week 13 Dallas Cowboys 22 2 nd place in NFC East Top Passer Dak Prescott 941 yards 8 touchdowns 3 interceptions Top Rusher Ezekiel Elliott 277 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Dez Bryant 16 receptions 212 yards 2 touchdowns There has been plenty of drama on and off the field for the Dallas Cowboys Running back Ezekiel Elliot has broken 100 yards on the ground just once through four games and averages two yards fewer per carry compared to last year Meanwhile quarterback Dak Prescott who only had four interceptions in 2016 has nearly reached that mark through four games On defense the Cowboys have a gem in defensive end Demarcus Lawrence who leads the NFL in sacks with 75 Rookie linebacker Jaylon Smith has also been a force to reckon with recording a teamhigh 34 tackles The Cowboys were favorited by pundits to win the NFC East before the year began but so far have just one less loss than they did during the entire 2016 season Week 9 Seattle Seahawks 22 2 nd place in NFC West Top Passer Russell Wilson 1024 yards 7 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Carson 208 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Doug Baldwin 23 receptions 247 yards 1 touchdown Seattle knows how to win with just a few key elements strong defense and crafty playmaking from Russell Wilson Wilson the teams second leading rusher with 138 yards has been on the run for most of the season due to a shaky offensive line Eddy Lacy was brought in during the offseason to fill in as the groundandpound running back a spot previously occupied by Marshawn Lynch So far Lacy has been ineffective notching only 55 yards The Seahawks have outscored opponents 108 to 63 and held their last opponent the Indianapolis Colts to just three points in the second half of a big victory The Seattle defense has only allowed a team to score more than 18 just once this season Week 10 Minnesota Vikings 22 3 rd place in NFC North Top Passer Case Keenum 755 yards 3 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Dalvin Cook 354 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Stefon Diggs 22 receptions 391 yards 4 touchdowns The Vikings looked like the team to beat in the North after quarterback Sam Bradford led his team to a 2919 win over the New Orleans Saints in the regular season opener Unfortunately for Minnesota Bradford went down with a knee injury It looked like the Vikings would rely on the running game to carry the offense but rookie tailback Dalvin Cook tore his ACL while making a cut against the Detroit Lions in Week 4 Now the Vikings have relied but quarterback Case Keenum and receiver Stefon Diggs to help put points on the board which may still be the case by Week 10 when the Redskins host Minnesota at FedExField The defense remains the one constant for the team allowing an average of 19 points per game The team excels in creating interceptions totaling three on the season at times but has yet to force a fumble The run defense has also been impressive allowing just 285 yards on the ground through four games Week 11 New Orleans Saints 22 4 th place in NFC South Top Passer Drew Brees 1135 yards 8 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Mark Ingram 170 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Michael Thomas 25 receptions 310 yards 2 touchdowns At 38 years old Drew Brees continues to defy his age Currently the leagues fourthleading passer Brees averages 2765 yards per game as he inches closer to the NFLs alltime passing record At running back Adrian Peterson seems to have taken a backseat in head coach Sean Paytons offense The 11year veteran has only 27 carries on the year for 81 yards The defense was the biggest concern for the Saints during their first three games New Orleans had the second highest yards allowed per game heading into Week 4 but quickly turned things around in London shutting out the Miami Dolphins By Week 11 it should be clear whether this defensive performance was a fluke or if serious improvement has been underway in the Big Easy Week 12 Week 17 New York Giants 04 4 th place in NFC East Top Passer Eli Manning 1113 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Paul Perkins 61 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Sterling Shephard 21 receptions 254 yards 1 touchdown The Giants 04 start might be the biggest surprise in the NFL Turnovers have played a large part in New Yorks journey to the bottom of the league Manning has thrown the ball to defenders four times while opposing quarterbacks have yet to throw a pick against the Giants defense The team brought in receiver Brandon Marshall during the offseason to compliment Odell Beckham Jr but neither wideout has played up to par Sterling Shephard however has burst onto the scene as the Giants leading receiver gaining 49 more yards than Beckham and 54 more yards than Marshall The Giants have also been seriously outgained on the ground Opponents have run for 571 yards against New Yorks defense while the Giants own backs have only managed 237 yards Washingtons last game of the season will be played at MetLife Stadium and the outcome may shape the final standings of the NFC East Week 14 Los Angeles Chargers 04 4 th place in AFC West Top Passer Philip Rivers 1107 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Melvin Gordon 168 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Keenan Allen 24 receptions 334 yards 1 touchdown Facing two teams who started 04 may be the morale boost Washington needs heading into the final stretch of the season The recently relocated Chargers have had trouble maintaining consistency on defense Los Angeles ranks last in yards allowed after first contact with 26 and has been outgained on the ground 654 yards to 270 yards Meanwhile quarterback Philip Rivers has caught the interception bug not at all helped by the fact that he has been sacked six times this season This isnt to say the Chargers have been a pushover all season Excluding a 14point loss to the Chiefs the Chargers have been outscored by an average of 23 points Week 15 Arizona Cardinals 22 3 rd place in NFC West Top Passer Carson Palmer 1282 yards 5 touchdowns 5 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Johnson 93 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Larry Fitzgerald 26 receptions 276 yards 2 touchdowns Its never good when a quarterbacks touchdowns and interceptions totals are equal and his sack total of 17 tops the NFL However Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense have found ways to win by the narrowest of margins The Cardinals never meant to lean on Palmers arm but a Week 1 injury to running back David Johnson severely limited Arizonas ground game The defense has created opportunities but has failed to capitalize forcing four fumbles but never recovering Three interceptions have led to better field position for the offense but if Arizona wants to hold its own against Washington Palmer will have to keep the ball away from Josh Norman and the rest of the Redskins secondary So far Washingtons secondary has done well in creating turnovers Week 16 Denver Broncos 31 2 nd place in AFC West Top Passer Trevor Siemian 888 yards 7 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher CJ Anderson 330 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Demaryius Thomas 18 receptions 247 yards 0 touchdowns After once again earning the starting role in the offseason quarterback Trevor Siemian has performed admirably through 2017 However his 13 sacks are tied for fifth highest in the league When the offensive line struggles in pass protection it exceeds expectations in creating running lanes CJ Anderson and the rest of the Denver running attack has outrushed opponents by 369 yards This is in part due to the best facet of Denvers game the defense The front seven contained running backs to 24 yards per carry and allowed an average of 508 yards a game The unit also has two recovered fumbles and four interceptions on the year Luckily for the Redskins the Broncos will have to descend from their milehigh city and meet Washington at

four games the Redskins have turned in plenty of incredible plays in an exciting first quarter of the season Heres a look at the best of the best In four games the Washington Redskins have compiled a gallery of highlights From the lastminute win against the Los Angeles Rams to the Sunday Night blowout of the Oakland Raiders Washingtons players on offense and defense made some outstanding feats Here is some of the best of Redskins football a quarter of the way through the 2017 season Kerrigans PickSix Ignites FedEx Field With a 13point deficit against a division rival at home Washingtons season opener was about to get out of hand Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz had eluded the Redskins front seven and had already thrown two touchdowns If not for linebacker Ryan Kerrigan Washington may have been down by three touchdowns before halftime On the Eagles fifth drive Wentz tossed a short pass the right sideline The ball was tipped at the line by defensive lineman Stacy McGee wobbled off course and landed right in Kerrigans hands From there it was a short 25yard jog to the end zone Its what you practice every day just catching the ball and taking it to the house Kerrigan said Fortunate to find myself in that situation and fortunate to make the play Kerrigan scored Washingtons first points of the season and brought his team right back in the game Thompson Bullies His Way To Incredible TD Washingtons second big play of the season came when the team needed it most Down 137 against the Eagles the Redskins were on the move and within scoring range Cousins feeling the pressure from the blitz checked down to running back Chris Thompson in the middle of the field Thompson sprinted and spun his way through four missed tackles before reaching the end zone His 29yard catchandrun gave Washington its first and only lead of the game I was just looking to make a big play Thompson said I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play Thompson Goes 61 Yards To The House Thompson continued his highlightfilled campaign in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams With a 1310 lead head coach Jay Gruden called in a delayed handoff for the gadget running back The Rams fell for the draw rushing towards Cousins who quickly gave the ball to his running back My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing Thompson said Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays A few nice blocks busted the field wide open for Thompson who never touched a defender on his way to the end zone The Redskins went up 2010 following the extra point and eventually earned their first win of the season Foster Seals Win In LA With Interception Rookie quarterback Jared Goff had kept his Los Angeles Rams afloat against the Redskins and needed just one drive to tie things up at 27 in the fourth quarter With seconds ticking off the clock Goff dropped back at his own 28yard line and slung the ball to receiver Cooper Kupp What Goff didnt see was linebacker Mason Foster making a beeline for the ball He cut in front up Kupp and bobbled the ball before securing the interception Foster who had been battling a shoulder injury during the game slid down at the 19yardline essentially ending the game and handing Washington its first win I mean it definitely feels great Foster said I felt like I had to redeem myself for some of the plays last week I felt like I could have been better on Doctson Hauls In 52Yard Bomb From Cousins Wide receiver Josh Doctson barely saw the field his rookie year and spent most of his time sidelined and injured During the Redskins Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders Doctson blazed back into action redeeming himself on a 52yard touchdown pass Washington had already put up 14 points on the Raiders but it was Doctsons score that put the nail in the coffin On first down quarterback Kirk Cousins fired deep to the TCU product who had to contest with cornerback David Amerson for the 5050 ball Doctson miraculously came down with the catch and fought to reach the end zone Amerson still wrapped around his waist Nicholson and Fuller Light Up Sunday Night Before Week 3 Oakland quarterback Derek Carr had not been intercepted It took just one pass against Washingtons secondary for that to change One Carrs first pass attempt of the game receiver Amari Cooper slowed down just enough for the ball to sail out of reach Safety Montae Nicholson flew in and snatched the ball before Cooper could reach it setting Washington up for its first touchdown Cornerback Kendall Fuller nabbed Carrs second interception taking advantage of an underthrown pass intended for Seth Roberts midway through the second quarter Just a few plays later the Redskins found themselves ahead by two touchdowns Pryor Silences Arrowhead Stadium With 44Yard Score Wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr gave his team an early lead after hauling in an bomb from quarterback Kirk Cousins Three minutes into the game Cousins looked to the right sideline and saw a oneonone matchup between Pryor and defensive back Marcus Peters Cousins tested the matchup and saw immediate success Pryor nudged away from Peters just enough to get open without drawing a flag and caught Cousins pass which flew just beyond the outstretched fingertips of Peters Washington would go up 70 and stayed competitive the entire game against the NFLs

HailMail When is Josh Norman returning Well get more of an official update on Normans status this week as the Redskins return to practice following their bye week Having said that Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said after last weeks game against the Kansas City Chiefs that Norman is currently weektoweek with a rib fracture Norman hinted on Twitter that his return may not be for another month leaving Washington potentially without their star cornerback for the next few weeks Its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Norman said after the Kansas City game Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that If Norman really is out for the next few weeks the Redskins will likely rely on Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill the void opposite Bashaud Breeland and Kendall Fuller in the slot Dunbar originally filled in for Norman after his exit against the Chiefs but the thirdyear Florida product was also briefly sidelined with Moreau coming in for a few plays Now in his third season at cornerback after making the switch from wide receiver as a rookie Dunbar has appeared in 29 regular season games with four starts As for Moreau hes mostly played special teams to date for the Redskins But Gruden said that defensive backs coach Torrian Gray had the UCLA product as one of the highest rated cornerbacks in the 2017 NFL Draft Now the Redskins could see what the 23yearold offers from a defensive aspect early in his career RealMacDaddy asks How are we going forward with the running game We have success but Perine doesnt seem like he can get it done HailMail This has been a question thats been asked quite a bit over the last few months but the answer has remains the same When healthy Rob Kelley remains the Redskins featured back with Samaje Perine spelling the secondyear Tulane product at times Then of course theres Chris Thompson who has gotten off to a hot start as Washingtons thirddown back Through Washingtons first four games of the season Perine is actually the leading rusher with 143 yards to Thompsons 142 and Kelleys 131 This has mostly been due to the fact that Kelley missed the second half of the Redskins games against the Los Angeles Rams and Chiefs while also being inactive against the Oakland Raiders Perine has flashed bigplay potential at times but the 2017 fourthround pick had a late fumble against the Raiders and failed to secure a pitch from Kirk Cousins against the Chiefs The fumble went down under Cousins name but it was Perine who never was able to keep his hands on the ball before it rolled out of bounds Despite a few ball security errors Gruden and the coaching staff are confident Perine can have success in his rookie campaign I think hes still in the process of developing like all young running backs are Gruden said The kid for Kansas City is a special guy Kareem Hunt but Perine is in a spot right now where hes just continuing to get the workload especially if Rob Kelley has got an ankle injury for any due time Hes going to get more and more reps and hes going to get better and better JKStoneberger asks Vernon Davis looks like he has found his youth Is it possible since Garcon is gone that Davis can be a hybrid TEReciever HailMail It seems like theres nothing that can slow down Vernon Davis Now in his 12 th NFL season at 33 years old Davis possesses speed and agility that players 10 years his youth dont even have for their game After being held catchless in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Davis has caught eight passes for 160 yards and a touchdown in Washingtons last three games He followed up a fivecatch 58yard performance against the Raiders with two catches for 89 yards against the Chiefs A 69yard catchandrun moved Davis past Heath Miller 6569 for the 10thmost career receiving yards by a tight end in NFL history And entering Week 5 action his 20 yards per reception paced all NFL tight ends Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said last week Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player He takes care of himself While theres so many positives to Davis game the Redskins still want to get reps for their young receivers in Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and even Ryan Grant So it may be hard to picture Davis role expanding past what it already is a toplevel No 2 tight end option who can fill in for Jordan Reed if needed Sure he can make the tough catches but the Redskins want to get the wide receivers more involved on a consistent basis Theres certainly still a lot of hope that Doctson can fill some of what Pierre Garon left behind when he signed with the San Francisco 49ers Even though Doctson dropped a potential gamewinning touchdown against Kansas City hes beginning to make more plays in the passing game I have no problem with any of them at any given time but I think the more Josh obviously if he can stay healthy gets on the practice field does it in practice the more reps he will get Gruden said Were fine with Josh and where hes at', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington

interceptions on the year He has a completion average of 593 percent and has been sacked 15 times This isnt to say Shanahan is not afraid of dialing up the passing game Hoyer threw 46 attempts in Week 5 and 49 attempts in Week 4 but still only managed a 31 touchdowntointerception ratio in those two games Wide receiver Pierre Garon has been Hoyers main target this season Garcon arrived in San Francisco in the offseason after departing from a fiveyear stint with the Redskins His newest season with his third team has been up and down recording one game with more than 100 yards receiving but two games with less than 40 yards With no touchdowns to his name San Francisco leans on running back Carlos Hyde in the red zone Hyde who ran for 332 yards in five games has two of the teams combined seven offensive touchdowns this year With the offense still working out the kinks San Franciscos defense has been keeping the team competitive The unit ranks second in the NFL with 10 forced fumbles four of which can be attributed to rookies Elijah Lee and Victor Bolden Jr Linebacker Navarro Bowman leads the team with 38 total tackles However Bowman suffered a stinger during Sundays contest against the Colts Luckily for San Francisco linebacker RayRay Armstrong the teams second leading tackler remains as healthy as ever Armstrong has recorded more solo tackles than Bowman with 27 and grabbed an interception in each of his last two games Outside linebacker Elvis Dumerville was a nonfactor during his first three games but since playing the Cardinals has recorded a teamleading 35 sacks San Franciscos dominant linebacker corps will be tasked with containing former 49ers tight end Vernon Davis The 33yearold Washington DC native spent a decade in San Francisco and will face his former team for the first time since leaving in 2015 Davis stands as the Redskins third leading receiver this season and broke off a huge 69yard catch and run last week against the Kansas City

Performance Center OFFENSE DEFENSESPECIAL TEAMS', 'The Redskins tight end spent 10 years with the San Francisco 49ers after they selected him in the 2005 NFL Draft Sunday hell face them for the first time in his career In 2006 the San Francisco 49ers entered the NFL Draft seeking to bolster an offense that finished last in the NFL in total offense With secondyear quarterback Alex Smith the No 1overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft already in the fold San Francisco wanted to surround him with talent So with the No 6overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft the 49ers selected University of Maryland tight end Vernon Davis It was just the fourth time in NFL Draft history that a tight end was selected in the first six picks Expectations were high for Davis especially after stellar showing at the NFL Combine in which he ran the 40yard dash in 438 seconds still a record among tight ends while tallying a broad jump nearly a foot further than the competition at his position Despite the heavy expectations placed on him Davis didnt disappoint during his time with the 49ers In nineplus seasons in San Francisco the Washington DC native recorded 441 receptions for 5640 yards and 55 touchdowns He toppled 850 receiving yards in three different seasons had two 13touchdown campaigns and was a twotime Pro Bowler Even though Davis was a centerpiece for some of San Franciscos best teams of the last decade his time with the 49ers quietly came to an end two years ago when he was traded midseason to the Denver Broncos This Sunday will mark the first time hes faced the team that drafted him since his departure It feels great Its been a while since Ive ran into the San Francisco 49ers Davis said this week Its going to be great I look forward to it Its going to be great to see some of the people that I had an opportunity to cultivate relationships with when I got drafted so that will be nice I cant wait for that While Davis has a lot of memories playing with the same 49ers team hell oppose this week he understood why he was traded His focus now 23 months after his 49ers tenure ended is helping the Washington Redskins get to 32 on the young season You get to a point where you move on You understand its the nature of the business It happens Davis said You play with the team you get traded or just something happens For me its just another game Im just really really excited to be able to see some of the familiar faces that I had to cultivate relationships with It looked as if Davis had slowed significantly during his time with the Broncos He recorded just 20 receptions for 201 yards in nine regular season games and didnt factor in at all during the teams playoff run to Super Bowl 50 Even though he admitted that he was never fully comfortable in Denver Davis has rebounded in Washington In 2016 Davis recorded 44 receptions for 583 yards and two touchdowns This past offseason he was rewarded with a new contract that will keep him in his hometown for a little bit longer So far the Redskins decision to resign him has paid off Entering Week 5 action Davis paced all tight ends with an average of 20 yards per reception On A 69yard catchandrun against the Kansas City Chiefs Davis moved past Heath Miller 6569 for the 10thmost career receiving yards by a tight end in NFL history Catching the ball at Kansas Citys 45yard line in stride Davis zigzagged his way through the defense for his longest reception since the 2010 season It showed that Davis still has a lot left in the tank even in his 12 th NFL season Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins said hes been nicknamed el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Redskins head coach Jay Gruden meanwhile describes him as a physical freak Its proof that Davis is still very much the same player he was during his time with the 49ers Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player He takes care of himself', 'The Redskinscom crew breaks down the key players and matchups to keep an eye on during Sundays Redskins49ers 2017 Week 6 showdown at FedExField in Landover Md Redskins49ers Ingredients For Victory is presented by Papa Johns Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win DONT LET PIERRE GET COMFORTABLE IN A FAMILIAR SETTING It will be an interesting site on Sunday when the San Francisco offense takes the field for the first time and Pierre Garon is wearing a No 15 49ers jersey For five seasons 201216 Garon was a mainstay for Washingtons offense In total the former Mount Union product finished his time in Washington in the top 10 in both receptions 376 and receiving yards 4549 in franchise history His 21 touchdown receptions are also tied for 12th most among all Redskins skill players in history While he has yet to score so far in his 49ers tenure hes right on track for another 1000yard season Through five games he has 28 receptions for 379 yards Washingtons cornerbacks even without former AllPro Josh Norman have to be ready for Garons aggressive attitude Hes an exceptional guy he makes plays on the ball and as well he runs his routes hard said cornerback Bashaud Breeland who will slide into the No 1 role during Normans injury Its going to be a good task Im all for it San Francisco may not have the bevy of playmakers at its disposal like Washington but head coach Kyle Shanahan likes to move Garon around to get him into advantageous spots Even if hes asked to run shorter routes or go across the middle Redskins head coach Jay Gruden knows hes still one of the top possessiontype receivers in the game today He is really good after the catch Thats the one thing we really have to make sure that we tackle well when he gets the ball in his hands out in space because he can really run after the catch Gruden said He runs very good precise crisp routes and has got strong hands He does all the underneath stuff He can hit you down the sidelines from time to time so he is definitely their best playmaker Stephen Czarda PREPARE FOR THE YOUNG AND HUNGRY While the 49ers enter Sundays game without a win on their resume the Redskins understand that San Francisco could easily have four wins on the season After losing a rather onesided game in the opener against the Carolina Panthers the 49ers last four losses have been by a combined 11 points And in each of their last two games they were taken out in overtime I know the feeling of being winless and just being anxious to finally get that first win said running back Chris Thompson So theyre going to come out wanting to beat us wanting to upset us at home Despite their failure to secure a win so far this year the 49ers have talent on both sides of the ball Offensively of course Garon is the steady threat on the outside complemented by speedsters Aldrick Robinson and Marquise Goodwin They also have Carlos Hyde at running back as the Ohio State product once again is averaging more than 45 yards per carry Defensively San Francisco is loaded with young talent particularly along the line Arik Armstead DeForest Buckner and Solomon Thomas were all taken in the first round of their respective NFL Drafts Armstead and Buckner both offer unique size coupled with their athleticism as both are 6foot7 and more than 290 pounds So for a Washington offense that could be without Trent Williams and Rob Kelley the team must be ready for a group thats ready to strike They have talent Gruden said We are talking about Buckner and Armstead Solomon Thomas and then they bring Elvis Dumervil off the bench for third down rusher Aaron Lynch is a good rusher So they are very talented without a doubt The linebacker play has been solid and obviously they have safeties out the kazoo Stephen Czarda GET CROWDER AND REED THEIR REDEMPTION Washington has quite a bit of depth at the tight end position and its showed so far this season While veteran Vernon Davis leads the teams tight end receiving yards two other players will look to make an impact on Sundays game Jordan Reed who missed the Oakland game entirely and saw limited action against Kansas City finally appears to be ready to go Jamison Crowder another weapon who has dealt with injuries also seems likely as a major factor against the 49ers I think youll see more of Jamison Crowder hopefully head coach Jay Gruden said He is one of our best skill players We have got to get him more involved in the offense Reed and Crowder have almost identical stats through four games With 14 receptions apiece Crowder 107 yards inched pass Reed 106 yards in receiving two weeks ago Gruden said defenses have been clogging the middle of the field to prevent big plays from Washingtons various tight ends He added that will likely change as the outside receivers improve opening up more opportunities for Crowder and Reed underneath We have a number of guys that we need to get the ball to but it is key for us to just be patient spread the ball and get the ball to the open guy Gruden said Brandon Hill FILLING THE NORMAN VOID In the absence of star cornerback Josh Norman while hes dealing with a rib fracture Gruden and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky will look upon a duo of young cornerbacks in Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill his shoes Dunbar a thirdyear player out of Florida is expected to make the fifth start of his career on Sunday his first of the 2017 season Despite the relative lack of starting experience on the field the 25yearold is not short on confidence He thinks he can cover anybody anytime anywhere Gruden said And thats a great mentality to have as a corner and thats the way he feels Hes been out here at practice covering DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon last year and this year with all these other guys Moreau meanwhile is looking to seize an increased role in Normans absence The rookie has appeared in all four of the Redskins games this season and has recorded six tackles While fans have not seen much of the UCLA product in a regular season setting just yet Gruden stresses the importance of his physical tools in Sundays matchup against the 49ers He has speed Gruden said of his rookie defensive back Dunbar and Fabian both are very very fast and that helps when youre playing against a worldclass sprinter like Marquise Goodwin and Aldrick Robinson Theyre both very very fast So its very important we try to match some speed with speed and those guys can both run Jay Cannon', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Tuesday October 10 2017 All reports

Look Around The League', 'The Redskins had the earliest scheduled bye on the NFL season and it may have come at the right time Back to work this week though the team faces 12 more regular season games starting with Sundays 49ers matchup Following a contest in which a banged up Washington Redskins squad came up just short against the Kansas City Chiefs the team enjoyed a Week 5 bye to recover from a tough early season schedule The Week 5 bye was the earliest scheduled week off for four teams as the Redskins along with the Atlanta Falcons New Orleans Saints and Denver Broncos did not play over the weekend Most players stuck around in Loudoun County Va as did running back Chris Thompson who has been one of Washingtons top contributors so far this season This year I felt that it was different a lot of guys really just stayed here and just kind of hung around Thompson said It was just funny because Kirk Cousins asked me and he said to him it seemed like a lot of people just stayed this year but were back at it now so were excited to get on this 12game stretch and the ultimate goal is to win out I wish we could but thats our focus just focus on San Fran this week and just take it week by week Cornerback Bashaud Breeland added that the bye afforded the team time to refresh our minds They hadnt been off for more than a few days since the offseason back in July It gave us a good chance of putting the loss to the Chiefs behind us and going forward for this 12game stretch Breeland said The motto going is the same motto coming out Were going to put that behind us and get ready to prepare for the 49ers Whether or not an early bye helps or hurts a team in the long run can be debated but Redskins head coach Jay Gruden is confident the team will be prepared for the final three months of the regular season starting with Sundays game against the 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md Obviously the injuries are a little bit of a concern but for the most part the bye happens when it happens Gruden said Now we just have to understand we have 12 weeks of straight ball Thats just 12 straight weeks These guys have to commit themselves to a long haul Youd like to break up it at maybe the halfway point like we had last year but now that we know when it is we have to just adjust our schedules and really all commit ourselves to the grind of the NFL season 12 weeks in a row hopefully 13 hopefully 14 15 weeks in a row While the 49ers enter Sundays matchup as one of three teams in the NFL at 05 the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns being the others the Redskins arent going to take San Francisco lightly After being blown out in the regular season opener against the Carolina Panthers the 49ers last four losses have been by a combined 11 points Additionally the have lost backtoback games in overtime They have pieces to be good Gruden said Theyre just trying to implement a system and I think it will take some time but theyre very dangerous Thats for sure The 49ers have a few familiar faces including wide receiver Pierre Garon who spent five seasons in Washington Twice the Mount Union product recorded 1000yard campaigns and holds the franchise singleseason record for receptions 113 set in 2013 Defensively the 49ers are led by veteran linebackers NaVorro Bowman RayRay Armstrong and Elvis Dumervil I dont think you can underestimate any team said tight end

rehab The momentum and optimism surrounding veteran defensive lineman Phil Taylor Srs return to the NFL was suddenly halted during the Redskins third preseason game this year when a tear of his left quad forced the team to place him on Injured Reserve for the season Less than two months later after a successful surgery Taylor is making promising strides in his recovery and rehab After getting rid of crutches last week Taylor said Tuesday that he was able to take the brace off his quad allowing him to walk upright without assistance for the first time since his injury Rehab is going to start getting more intense now that I can walk Taylor said Im looking forward to the journey Its an awesome thing It sucks to be hurt but its an awesome thing to be here and still fighting to play the game you love Taylor injured his quad early in the Redskins 2317 victory over the Bengals He and teammates initially thought it might be just a deep thigh bruise but MRI results indicated a tear the next day further delaying Taylors comeback another year After not having played a regular season game since 2014 the news initially stung Just working my way back being out of the game for two years and working my way back to getting in the rotation and being on the field a lot and getting the chance to be a starter it was tough Taylor said Playing for my hometown team all the momentum going in and its the nature of the beast called the NFL things happen and unfortunately I got hurt I was in a tough place when Dr West told me Taylor added At the same time I thought to myself Ive been here before I made it this far and I can do it again Taylors optimism and general good spirits come from those previous experiences multiple knee injuries which led to surgical scopes hampering his game and forcing him off the field for multiple stints early in his career with the Browns It taught him perserverance Taylor signed with the Broncos in 2016 but hurt his knee again during training camp and was placed on the injured list before being released The Redskins called him at the end of last season around the time Taylor had considered retiring and he prepared for another opportunity Despite another injury and setback he has leaned on his past to inform the way he approaches an often solitary experience In Cleveland when I got hurt it was like I distanced myself I put myself into these moods and I wasnt watching football Taylor said Now Im still watching all the games When I got hurt in Cleveland I didnt watch football in those two years Its more of a mental thing than a physical thing It is physical because youre injured but at the same timeif youre injured and you let your mind race and start thinking about other things then thats when you can go into a dark place Keep a good support staff around you people that motivate you and keep you going and pushing yourself thats how you come out on top In the time he isnt spending at the team facility receiving treatment and rehabbing Taylor has the advantage of spending more time with his parents who live in the area Hes also in communication with his teammates who he sees around the building and has enjoyed watching them play Every week watching these guys get after it its not a surprise Taylor said I was around these guys all the time every day at camp and its just really showing how Coach Jim Tomsula coaches us and the passion he has for his guys in that room and the passion he has for the game it really shows how the defensive line plays out there It shows how the whole backend plays its awesome And yes Taylor looks forward to speaking with Tomsula just as much as anyone when he visits the building I was messing with him at the facility today Taylor said with a laugh I ran into him and I was messing with him about the Oakland game He looked like a little mob boss in that game Hes a confident coach and it shows in all his guys Even the ones who cant play', 'Former Washington Redskins defensive

OFFENSE DEFENSESPECIAL TEAMS', 'The former University of Wisconsin star signed with Washingtons practice squad last week His fourth NFL team Stave is trying to learn the Redskins system as he goes One month and one day after being waived by the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Joel Stave was signed by the Washington Redskins joining the team as a practice squad member last week Ever since his senior season at Wisconsin in 2015 Stave has bounced around the league appearing on the rosters of four NFL teams since May of 2016 Going undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft Stave signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a practice squad member and has since made stops in Seattle and Kansas City Throughout a frustrating month of September Stave went back to his roots in the Milwaukee area spending time with his dad and even trying his hand at woodworking to pass the time After the month at home in Wisconsin he was understandably happy to get the call from the Redskins It was fun getting a call and having a chance to come and workout So far I really like the staff I like the guys Stave toldf Redskinscom As long as youre getting calls its a good time For Stave this is not the first time he has had the task of getting acclimated to a new locker room but he seems to be handling it well with the Redskins Its different every time the quarterback said Most important thing is that you got to come in and take care of your business If I do everything I can to learn the offense as quick as possible and just help out wherever I can help out thats a good way to get yourself used to a team and get guys comfortable being around you and you the same being comfortable being around them Stave joins a duo of experienced players in Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy to fill out the quarterback crew Both Cousins and McCoy have been on the Redskins roster for several years now and are easy guys to work with as Stave attests to They both seem like excellent guys Stave said I was a redshirt freshman when Kirk was in his senior year at Michigan State so I got to watch him play a couple times live there And obviously I knew all about Colt coming out of Texas but its cool to get to meet the guys and talk to them a little bit The 6foot4 gunslinger comes to Washington after a standout career at Wisconsin where he graduated as the alltime winningest quarterback at the school with a record of 3110 Stave was able to see the field in two games for the Chiefs this preseason going 4of9 on passes with 80 yards and a touchdown', 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Being a father has given him a broader perspective about playing football Predictably becoming a father for the first time has given Cousins a better perspective about how to approach his life and football career When you throw a few interceptions and come home from a tough loss I think itsgoing to eat at you a little less Cousins said I think when you re on top of the world after a big win youre going to come home and realize that youre not as big of a deal as you think you are I think thats a healthy thing Cousins said he read Drew Brees book that discussed how the Saints quarterback had better time management after the birth of his son because it gave him incentives to finish certain priorities on time so he could be home longer with his family Ray Wright our old strength coach whos now in San Francisco when I got married said I believe youre not your best self as a player until your married Cousins said A lot of times guys play better once theyre married and Id maybe even say the same thing about having a son I think you could maybe even become a better football player after that happens 2 He would have preferred a later Bye Week but was glad to have time with his son The Redskins received their Bye Week on the early side this season coming after just four games This came in handy for many on the defensive side of the ball that got injured during the Chiefs game but it now means that the team must prepare itself for 12 consecutive weeks without break Ultimately Cousins would prefer to have a Bye Week closer to the middle of the season like they did last year after visiting London but he was also happy to spend the first week of his newborn son Coopers life without his typical work week I think we were fortunate with the timing of our babys arrival that the Bye Week came when it did but its always tough when its so early Cousins said You prefer a Bye Week later in the year when its really a halftime of the season but well take what we can get Earlier in the year I guess like I said we had the benefit with our baby and when you go back and look at the start of training camp and how long weve been going at it it probably is about halfway now Well take advantage of the time we rested and got recharged and were ready to go now During the Bye week Cousins posted a lot of photos of his time with Cooper showing off his dad swag I felt like I had dad swag before I was a dad Im the kind of guy in high school who would wear a braided belt and cargo shorts White socks that came up half way up my ankles Cousins joked I was probably one step away from Velcro shoes and a visor and an oversized polo tucked in Maybe even a Palm Pilot on my belt Actually Kyle Shanahan used to tell me when he saw me in my game uniform he said Kirk your swag is having no swag Thats kind of always been my swag and I guess Ill stick with it But yeah I guess I kind of fit the dad vibe for the most part 3 Hes developed a lot as a quarterback even over the last year Just because Cousins is in his third year as the starting quarterback doesnt mean there are things he isnt intent on improving With each year comes more comfortability and more nuances for Cousins to develop and hone Well Ive developed every area of my game from the end of year two to now in the middle of year six Cousins said Everything from protections audibles understanding the run game reads coverage recognition blitz recognition Just how to handle a 16 game season and how to win in this league how to play on the road Theres so many elements of being a quarterback As Ive played Ive picked them all up and I feel like every year I take another step Cousins has attributed most of his progress to the coaches around him I think most of us need to have great people around us to be successful he said Maybe not the case with every player but most of us do and Im no different Ive been so fortunate to have Mike Shanahan Kyle Shanahan Matt Lafleur those people leading me my first few years And then to have Sean McVay Jay Gruden Matt Cavanaugh Ive felt like has had a big impact on my career and now Kevin OConnell 4 Kyle Shanahan always believed in his potential which has meant a lot to him The Redskins will face some familiar opponents this weekend when they host the 49ers Theres wide receiver Pierre Garon who Cousins knew for his whole career playing for the Burgundy and Gold and then there is former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan The latter played an important role in Cousins young NFL career as he developed at the professional level After providing a list of quarterback coaches and offensive coaches that have impacted his career Cousins pointed out Shanahan for a specific reason Kyle stands out looking back just because the information we have now we didnt have then Cousins said No one knew what was going to happen and Kyle believed in me when it was just potential There was no production I hadnt done anything to earn his belief and he believed in me and Mike Shanahan did too and Matt Lafleur for that matter I think thats when I look back and say Wow those guys knew what they were talking about because I hadnt done anything and they told me I had a lot of potential and could do something I think thats when I look back and then respect their knowledge at the quarterback position and what it takes to play well in this league Cousins had goals that were as simple as making the team knowing that next year was never promised to him Hearing that belief from Mike from Kyle from Matt right away gave me a chance to set my sights a little higher and to expect a little more out of myself and to work for more Cousins said It certainly is a shot in the arm when someone believes in you and that was the case and like I said Ive been fortunate to have that really all the way through my career 5 Cousins is constantly involved in talking with receivers to refine their connections While the offense has steadily progressed injuries to receivers have made things inconsistent Jordan Reed Josh Doctson Jamison Crowder and the full potential of the receiving corps hasnt been able to blossom After every game Cousins makes sure to speak with each of his teammates to go over route concepts that the team missed the previous week Cousins has noticed that all of his receivers care deeply about the details of their games and work actively with him on correcting mistakes and learn what the other is thinking about Theres a lot of precision with these routes the spacing and the timing and the depth and the motions and all that comes with reps and experience Ive been encouraged just because everyone in our offense wants to be on the details Cousins said We really care about the details and want to do it right and so its fun to work with them and coach them up and vice versa I respect them when they have something for me because I understand theyre trying to do it the right way Cousins elaborated on where and how these meetings exist I could be passing Ike Hilliard in the hall and say Hey tell Josh Doctson in his under route to get his shoulders down or it could be me passing Josh in the hall and saying the same thing It could be us in a meeting with Jay saying Hey why are we doing it this way Did we tell Terrelle Pryor Sr that already So its an ongoing conversation throughout the day and because we all love football we all are junkies and kind of eat it up and want to talk ball throughout the entire day', 'Just by the excitement and energy alone you wouldnt have been able to tell that fouryear old Madelyn Cabatic had gone through any adversity over the last three months In her burgundy Redskins dress Madelyn attended part of the teams practice on Wednesday toured some of the facility and watched the remainder of practice from a board room receiving the full VIP experience For a big Redskins and Ryan Kerrigan fan the day was a welcome reward and relief for enduring her fourth round of chemotherapy since the summer Near the end of June Madelyn was diagnosed with a Rhabdoid kidney tumor and had surgery shortly after It was too big to remove initially and a week later she underwent chemotherapy treatment The tumor was eventually removed in late August but Madelyn still has four rounds of treatment left as she fights through what has been a lifechanging experience and an emotional perspectivebroadening journey for her parents Vanessa and Jonathan and her little brother Nixon The biggest takeaway has been treasuring every moment with her Vanessa said We dont talk about it a lot Were just so thankful every day that shes with us our belief is just you know God puts us through something for a reason and shes so strong Vanessa grew up in Annandale Va while Jonathan was raised in Virginia Beach lifelong Redskins fans that are now raising Madelyn and Nixon in Aldie Va occasionally driving by the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park Wednesday was their first time seeing it up close an opportunity made possible through a former employee who connected them with the Washington Redskins Charitable Foundation We were originally not open to exposing her Vanessa said about Madelyn but realized the immense support her family had from friends around the area They began posting photos and updates and developed a hashtag for her bravelikemaddie and madelynstrong At the facility they all wore customized Tshirts too donning the hashtag and a Wonder Woman inspired logo with Madelyns initials colored gold for pediatric cancer awareness and purple her favorite color Shes just amazing and it teaches us to be kind and giving to others not only just for her but for others that are going through the exact same thing Vanessa said So really everyone looks towards the future they plan for something and something like this happens You cant plan that way Every day you have to treasure it and she reminds us of that every day You can read more about Madelyn on her GoFundMe page here', 'In todays Rewarding Moments In Redskins History presented by Maryland Lottery My Lottery Rewards we look back at John Halls gamewinning field goal to beat the Jets in the 2003 season opener Redskins kicker John Hall admitted that he had dreamed the entire offseason about making a gamewinning field goal to beat his former team the Jets in the 2003 season opener at FedExField On a Thursday night the dream was fulfilled with a 33yard field goal that split the uprights with five seconds left to propel the Redskins to a 1613 victory Its pretty much one of those stupid things you do when youre done practicing said Hall after the game You make up those situations where you have this or that and Im sure you know which team it was against Hall also nailed kicks from 50 and 22 yards to aid quarterback Patrick Ramsey who went 1723 passing for 185 yards a touchdown and an interception Laveranues Coles who had also just come to Washington from New York and would be traded back to the Jets for Santana Moss in 2005 caught five passes for 106 yards helping the Redskins get their third straight victory over the Jets at the time Ramsey set up the winning score with a 24yard run to the Jets 31yard line where they wound down the clock for Halls try In the end the JetSkins found a way to bury their former team For one of the few times in his life wide receiver Art Monk was nervous before an NFL game On the eve of the Redskins Monday Night Football matchup with the Broncos at RFK Stadium Monk knew he had the opportunity to break the NFL receptions record He wanted to get it out of the way and so did the Redskins who faced the Eagles the next week and wanted Monks attention and the teams attention on their division rival For a moment on that Oct12 night it looked as though the record would have to wait The Redskins were crushing the Broncos and throwing the ball wasnt particularly practical as the fourth quarter ran down But head coach Joe Gibbs pressed on He called three pass plays in a row for the eventual Hall of Famer during a final fourth quarter drive The third pass was the recordsetter a 10yard throw from Mark Rypien that Monk caught by the Broncos sideline with just more than three minutes left to play The reception made history pushing past Steve Largent and Monk was quickly lifted into the air by his teammates to celebrate I knew it was for the record It was a play designed for me to catch Monk said after the Redskins eventual 343 victory Im glad its over I was nervous before the gamethats something Im not used to I was glad to be able to do it here With the game in hand those that didnt leave early for traffic were rewarded for their patience and roared for their wide receiver Monk finished the night with seven catches for 69 yards and would finish his career with 940 receptions now 17 th overall on the alltime receptions list in NFL history', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Thursday October 12 2017 All reports rumors and conjecture

young depth at the cornerback position will take a step up in playing time as veteran Josh Norman works his way back from a rib injury suffered in Week 4 Next man up is a mentality all NFL teams employ to their 53man rosters and its not different for the Washington Redskins for this week and potentially in the weeks that follow During Washingtons Week 4 matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City Mo cornerback Josh Norman was removed from the game with what was later diagnosed with a rib fracture After a few trips to the doctor its been determined that Norman will miss at least this weeks game against the San Francisco 49ers and maybe a few games after that as well In his absence the Redskins will look to Quinton Dunbar as the starting cornerback opposite Bashaud Breeland Rookie Fabian Moreau a thirdround pick out of UCLA could be used more frequently as well Dunbar of course is in his third season with the Redskins after an unlikely journey from undrafted wide receiver out of Florida to an active roster cornerback The 6foot2 197 pounder has appeared in 29 regular season games over the course of his young career with four starts So despite the fact hes seen just 47 defensive snaps this year Hes probably one of the guys obviously that have come the longest way from obviously the college days of being a wide receiver to being a starting defensive back in the NFL in just over a year said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Its a great story and a great tribute to him and how hard he works and how great his length is and how fast he is and how natural of an athlete he is Im excited to see him play on a longer basis see what he can do because he can bump and run Hes got long arms and he can run see how he does out in space But were excited to see him Gruden added that while Dunbar is still relatively new to the position he has the mindset that he can cover anybody anytime anywhere Thats a great mentality to have as a corner and thats the way he feels Gruden said Hes been out here at practice covering DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon last year and this year with all these other guys Hes just Line em up hes just bump and run Thats the mindset that he has and thats a great mindset to have Hes got a short memory If he does get beat hell come right back up and play bump and run and cover you Were excited to watch him play Breeland meanwhile said that Dunbar has shown some growth this offseason even though hes on the second team on the depth chart when everyone is healthy He comes in hes got to do what hes got to do Breeland said Theres no drop off As for Moreau hes played only 19 defensive snaps this year while excelling on special teams Like his draft classmate Montae Nicholson Moreau spent much of the offseason and a good chunk of training camp rehabbing from a torn pectoral muscle suffered during UCLAs pro day His 435 speed and overall athleticism could be needed on Sunday against 49ers wide receiver Marquise Goodwin who competed in the long jump during the London Olympics in 2012 So far this year Goodwin is averaging 174 yards on his 14 receptions Dunbar and Fabian both are very very fast and that helps when youre playing against a worldclass sprinter like Marquise Goodwin and Aldrick Robinson Gruden said Theyre both very very fast So its very important we try to match some speed with speed and those guys can both run but still its a great challenge But their skill set is coming along Fabian has not played a lot of pro football has not gotten a lot of reps in game situations but he might have to be thrown into the fire Were trying to get him more and more reps as the season goes on Dunbar will take over the starting reps right now while Josh is out and we feel good about where hes at', 'With Trent Williams status up in the air with a left knee injury the Redskins may have to rely on tackle TJ Clemmings to fill in for him this Sunday against the 49ers For the third practice this week left tackle Trent Williams played spectator nursing an injured left knee that has put his prospects for starting this Sunday against the 49ers in jeopardy With backup tackle Ty Nsekhe out for another couple weeks with a core muscle injury that means the Redskins will look to TJ Clemmings to bookend the left side of the offensive line Head coach Jay Gruden said that while he still holds onto hope that Williams could be ready for Sunday hes glad Clemmings has received all of the firstteam reps so far as he continues to learn the offense after being signed by the team less than a month ago Were getting TJ a lot of reps and a lot of work Gruden said He hasnt had a lot of work with Kirk Cousins as far as cadence rhythm of the game protections all that stuff This is new to him he just got here a few weeks ago so its really good to get him schooled with Ty Nsekhe being out also We have to get him up to speed and its been a great couple days for him Hes doing a much better job Clemmings was brought in for depth primarily for the scenario in which the Redskin find themselves now with Nsekhe not able to return until potentially the Redskins matchup the Eagles Now the team might have to lean on him this Sunday Im just preparing Clemmings said Thats all you can do at this point Cant really worry about that right now just gotta do what Im asked to do and continue to prepare the same way I was before Nothing changes in that regard Clemmings 25 is used to filling in on the fly The former fourthround pick spent his first two seasons in Minnesota starting at right tackle and then moving over to left tackle last year when a couple of Vikings offensive lineman went down with injury He appeared in 31 regular season games with 30 starts 19 coming at right tackle and 11 at left tackle Playing tackle is still a relatively new responsibility for him He spent the first half of his college career at the University of Pittsburgh playing along the defensive line and the only collegiate snaps he played at left tackle came at the Senior Bowl I think the one thing offensive line is just a position you have to learn left guard Shawn Lauvao said TJs doing a good job hes been doing whats been asked of him Like anything repetition is the master of all teachers You just keep working at it Guiding him through this expedited process has been offensive line coach Bill Callahan who Clemmings says hes grateful to have with him and Williams handing out advice when its needed Pretty much every play I look back and hes telling me to try something do something coaches me up and its pretty good Clemmings said To be able to have Coach Callahan and Trent both giving me nuggets on the practice field obviously its not like that in a game situation but just getting the reps in the week and talk about that stuff its good Those who have worked against Clemmings when he initially arrived including practice squad linebacker Pete Robertson have already seen his growth as hes picked up what Lauvao calls a decentsized playbook Hes adapting well and Trent is doing a good job of coaching him up and you can tell the difference already in the weeks that hes been here Robertson said And hes athletic for a big guy as well Hes just taking in all the information he can and really just getting ready for Sunday If called upon Clemmings is looking forward to continuing the momentum of the run game which is averaging 130 yards per game The Redskins may have to limit a small portion of plays that only Williams might be capable of producing but Gruden remains confident in Clemmings adjusting quickly and keeping the offense rolling When youre talking about protection and youre talking about taking deeper drops and waiting for plays to develop down the field you may limit some of those and work on maybe quicker passing game and more playaction stuff get some help for the tackle here and there where Trent doesnt want any help If I give him help he gets upset Gruden said But I feel good about TJ and where hes at I dont think well have to change a whole lot We just have to be aware that sometimes the open side left tackle were so used to having Trent in there that when hes not in there we just have to be aware of that Thats all', 'A morning roundup of what the local and national media have to say about the Washington Redskins on Friday October 13

Around The League', 'While quarterback Kirk Cousins will catch up with his former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan he will also have the chance to face off with his former Michigan State teammate Brian Hoyer Among some of the notable storylines surrounding the Redskins matchup with the 49ers namely former coaches and players facing off with their previous teams Sundays game also marks the first time that Kirk Cousins will face off with his former Michigan State mentor now 49ers starting quarterback Brian Hoyer in a regular season game During Cousins first two years with the Spartans Hoyer was the starting quarterback in East Lansing leading the team to the Capital One Bowl in 2009 and grooming the future Redskins starter to take over for him before signing with the Patriots to start his career In the years since Cousins has met Hoyer just once on the opposing sideline during a preseason game against the Browns and missed him last year in Chicago when Matt Barkley filled in for Hoyer due to an injury I remember when I arrived to Michigan State just being very impressed with the way he threw the football Cousins said of Hoyer Id never been around a guy who threw it that well and Brian was really talented as a passer and thats why hes played as long as he has in the NFL On a team that also featured quarterback Nick Foles for a year until he transferred to Arizona Cousins felt as though NFLcaliber quarterbacks at Michigan State following the successful college career of Drew Stanton were the norm I just assumed everybody was that good and everybody had an arm Cousins said Oh man this is tough competition As time has proven Ive realized that not every school in the Big Ten or the country had that many quarterbacks like that who ended up playing in the NFL for that long It was a unique experience a lot of competition I think it made us all better Hoyer finished his Michigan State career as a consensus honorable mention AllBig Ten selection ranking among the Spartans career leaders in pass attempts No 2 at 896 passing yards No 3 with 6159 and pass completions No 3 at 500 Cousins meanwhile remains the alltime record holder in passing touchdowns 66 passing yards 9131 completions 723 for the school Their careers in the NFL have taken diverging paths Hoyer is on his seventh team in the league following stints in New England Pittsburgh Arizona Cleveland Houston and Chicago while Cousins has grown into a starting quarterback with the team that drafted him in 2012 Brian was a great mentor Cousins said I had so much to learn when I came out of high school and he was so far ahead of me so I just enjoyed watching learning Theres still things that I remember today that he told me when I was a freshman at Michigan State about different ways to use protections or how to throw a certain route that still have stuck with me and I still use it today as a tip or reminder Cousins said the two will occasionally text each other along with Stanton about Michigan State games and chat about the future of the program Its been fun because when I first met Brian he was only dating his now wife and now hes married with three kids Cousins said So life just keeps going Its amazing how we were totally different people 10 years ago when we first met Following Michigan States victory of the University of Michigan last Saturday Cousins remembered the feeling of stealing the Paul Bunyan Trophy in the Big House as a senior at the time the Spartans first victory at Michigan Stadium in 18 years Any away game that you win a flight home after the Rams game is a thrill but when you beat Michigan its about an hour and 15 minute bus ride from Ann Arbor back to East Lansing its a pretty good feeling walking out of that stadium hearing Go Green Go White being chanted across the stadium in the Big House Cousins said Its just a beautiful thing when you win in the state and you know for the next 12 months youve kind of solidified bragging rights for your fan base We say we walk the streets not the alleys when we win the game so its fun when you know youre going to walk the streets for the next 12 months', 'Check out these photos of the Washington Redskins preparing for Sundays matchup against the San Francisco 49ers Friday Oct 13 2017 at the Inova Sports Performance Center', 'The Redskins enter Sundays game against the 49ers with starting tackle Trent Williams questionable with a knee injury and two others listed as doubtful This weeks injury report is brought to you by Inova the Official Health System of the Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins head into Sundays game against the San Francisco 49ers with two players ruled out for the contest as well as two doubtful and one questionable Tackle Ty Nsekhe core muscle and cornerback Josh Norman rib are out for Washingtons Week 6 matchup with San Francisco while running back Rob Kelley ankle and safety Deshazor Everett hamstring are doubtful and tackle Trent Williams knee is questionable Kelley did not practice this week after originally suffering an ankle injury in the Redskins Week 4 game against the Kansas City Chiefs The secondyear Tulane product carried the ball seven times for 23 yards against Kansas City before being removed from the game in the second quarter He was replaced in the lineup by rookie Samaje Perine which is something the Redskins may have to do again this week Perine started against the Oakland Raiders in Week 3 when Kelley was dealing with a rib issue While Perine has had some tough moments early in his career including a fumble against the Raiders and a toss play against the Chiefs that he couldnt secure Redskins head coach Jay Gruden remains high on the 2017 fourthround pick I think hes still in the process of developing like all young running backs are The kid for Kansas City is a special guy Kareem Hunt but Perine is in a spot right now where hes just continuing to get the workload especially if Rob Kelley has got an ankle injury for any due time Gruden said last week Hes going to get more and more reps and hes going to get better and better With Nsekhe already ruled out and Williams status uncertain the Redskins may have to look to TJ Clemmings to either start at left tackle or be the swing tackle The former Minnesota Vikings draft pick made his Redskins debut against the Chiefs appearing on four offensive plays but could have an increased role this week We just picked up TJ and now he is our third he could be our second Gruden said Thats just the way it is in pro football and thats why it is important we continue to work with our practice squad guys our seventh and eighth offensive linemen make sure they get the reps so when their number is called they can perform But when youre talking about possibly taking Trent Williams out of the lineup I dont care who you put in there youre going to have a dropoff Thats just the way it is because hes the best in the league But we expect Clemmings to step up and play well and do the job As for Norman he could be out a few weeks after he also suffered his injury in the second quarter against the Chiefs two weeks ago With Bashaud Breeland sliding into the No 1 cornerback role the Redskins will look to Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to replace Norman in the lineup for now with Kendall Fuller continuing his presence against slot receivers In his third season with the Redskins now Dunbar has appeared in 29 regular season games with four starts While hes only appeared in relief this season Gruden believes the former college wide receiver has the right mindset when taking on some of the NFLs top receivers He thinks he can cover anybody anytime anywhere Gruden said And thats a great mentality to have as a corner and thats the way he feels Hes been out here at practice covering DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon last year and this year with all these other guys Hes just Line em up hes just bump and run Thats the mindset that he has and thats a great mindset to have Hes got a short memory If he does get beat hell come right back up and play bump and run and cover you Were excited to watch him play With Everett listed as doubtful the team could ask Kendall Fuller to play some safety if absolutley needed Kendall has been schooled a little bit at safety Gruden said Joshua Holsey would probably be up and he can play obviously nickel and corner so the fourth safety would probably be Kendall if we needed to', 'Washington Redskins cornerback Josh Norman was able to get back in the gym this week taking his first positive steps in a return to the field as he recovers from a fractured rib A diving tackle An awkward fall Thats all it took for the Washington Redskins to lose one of their most vocal defensive leaders While bringing down Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Chris Conley in Week 4 Josh Norman fell on his right side Slow to get up he quickly headed for the sideline clutching his ribs The sixyear veteran cornerback later left the field to be examined by trainers Before the game had ended Norman had been ruled out with a fractured rib Eleven days later Norman is still on the path to recovery sitting out practices to work with trainers and letting his body rest Before Thursday Norman seemed to be taking the recovery process slowly However three days before the Redskins take on the San Francisco 49ers Norman entered the weight room to find out where he stood Its a huge step just to get back in there and actually do some work he said I was doing nothing for a week and a half almost two weeks Laying down taking it easy and now I get back in the weight room for the first time today It was a big step for me Norman said he and his trainers did work on the treadmill the elliptical and lightly worked out his arms and legs While there was nothing too strenuous in his workouts he said he realized theres still a long way to go before hes ready to see the field Norman a fierce competitor and vocal leader was unsurprisingly upset about having to miss a game for the first time since 2014 Ive played through all kinds of injuries but this one has sat me down Norman said It kind of like caught me a little bit where I had to sit back and realize Damn this is kind of serious Normans upper body has taken a beating this season Since coming to the Redskins Norman has suffered wrist and shoulder injuries as well but he was able to play through them The latest injury to his ribs will have a significant effect on his speed due to the unfortunate placement Norman said that since the fracture it hurts when taking deep breaths Its right on my lungs so its kind of tough he said Im not going to lie to you sleeping is still tough yawning all the time Yawn and cough so much All he can do right now is focus on his lower body without straining his ribs or lungs Norman said the next step will be to see if he can run without experiencing too much pain Always the optimist he continued to look ahead in the season anxious to get back out there and help his teammates Maybe Ill start that next week maybe who knows he said Today really felt good Today was a good day', 'The

with his players and ribbed them as they walked down the stage That was especially the case for left tackle Trent Williams who did his best to smile without too much embrassment Doug Williams happy to observe was thrilled to take it all in and see the players out supporting a worthy endeavor Its good to see players coming off the field working all day relax and come and see this for a worthy cause

the opponents that we have The sky is the limit for the guys I think we are talented up front I think we are talented in the back end and the linebackers So it is where they want to take it not so much me Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky on his evaluation of the defense after four games 6 I think people are confident I think around here regardless of the year I think everybody should be confident that things are going to happen good That hasnt changed But I think everybody can see the talent on the tape a little bit more clearly offensively defensively and special teamwise I think were better at all three phases Head coach Jay Gruden on the improvements the team has made 5 This is the NFL everybody has talent Everybodys good everybody can win on any given day Were not going to let their record hinder our thoughts on what type of team they are Were definitely going to come out there and compete and expect a battle Cornerback Kendall Fuller on not taking the 49ers lightly 4 Hes an exceptional guy he makes plays on the ball and as well he runs his routes hard Its going to be a good task Im all for it Cornerback Bashaud Breeland on facing wide receiver Pierre Garon 3 Its been a while since Ive ran into the San Francisco 49ers Davis said this week Its going to be great I look forward to it Its going to be great to see some of the people that I had an opportunity to

day for two games He got benched for the terrible Joe Montana laughing if you can believe that Im sure he is ticked off So there is a lot of reason to be motivated He has probably a little bit more reason so to speak as do we We are all very hungry for this one and Im sure they are too Head coach Jay Gruden on the reunions happening this Sunday 1 Its always good to see people that you play with

Mason Foster on reuniting with former teammates this Sunday Top Top 10 Quotes is presented by GEICO 15 minutes can save you more than 15 on car insurance', 'The Redskins inside linebacker signed with team near the beginning of the 2015 season and has since played a big role on the defense He discusses his Bye Week activities how hes stayed positive through adversity and his experience living on the west coast How did you spend your Bye Week I spent the Bye Week playing Crash Bandicoot Mario Kart and just getting treatment I didnt really do anything Just tried to heal up came in here every morning for treatment My son got good grades he got a good report so I went and bought him a Nintendo Switch and they got the Mario Kart with the steering wheels We went crazy spent the whole week playing it treatment and Mario Kart Did you play it a lot by yourself or with your son A little bit of both I didnt think the Nintendo Switch was going to be that cool but when I got it for him it was off the hook Then the Crash Bandicoot is for the PS4 and hes really good Some of the levels are really hard so I have to pass him during the daytime I dont want him to see me die over and over I just try to pass him when hes at school How old are your two boys Rylan is four and a half and Kannon will be three in December I saw you took Rylan to swim lessons over the weekend Lessons are usually on Thursdays I used to be able to go after practice and stuff Now its Saturday so I cant make it Its cool They graduated their little classes theyre swimming pretty good now so its pretty crazy to see little kids swim like that What prompted you to get them into swim class When we were in Tampa we had a pool when Rylan was born and he just loves water So hes been doing swim lessons since he was eight to 10 months old They have a lot of swim classes in South Tampa so hes been learning to swim for a while And both my boys are like that so we had to get them swim lessons as soon as possible because theyll jump right in Did you learn to swim growing up Yeah my mom is a really good swimmer But I didnt really learn how to swim until I was seven years old I would just stay in the shallow end of the pool But my mom taught me we went to Hawaii one time in two days It was pretty crazy Did you see any movies over the break I saw the new Blade Runner Howd you like it It was good It was long I was thinking I would just pop into it after treatment but it was like three hours It was really good Ive got to see Kingsman Ive been slipping but Blade Runner scifi thats my kind of stuff Eventually you can take your kids to that movie but not right now Not right now theyre straight Teen Titans thats all they want to watch That sounds like a fitting title for what theyll become Yeah theyre going to be superheroes or something Astronauts One of the two On a separate topic I still cant imagine what its like to play with a shoulder thats been dislocated How would you describe it Its a little weird Its definitely painful and you feel restricted But for the most part its just about pain Your shoulder is already kind of messed up so if you can deal with the pain its whatever The pain its bad but its a part of football As long as I can play to the level I feel I can play to help the team win then I was alright I just love playing football I wouldnt want to miss any of that As long as it stays locked down and doesnt pop out again Im alright Do you feel offbalance or offkilter Maybe before with my other one my left was a little weird But here we have great athletic trainers great doctors and equipment people They way theyve got it locked down and set up and all the rehab I do makes it feel great It gets beat up but theyre able to bring me back the next day and Im ready to go again Where does the interception you had against Jared Goff rank amongst plays youve made with the Redskins Oh thats number one definitely Last year I didnt really get to play too much on third down or be on twominute drives I feel like you make those kinds of splash plays its something I really always wanted to do ever since college try to make interceptions and sacks big plays that end the game It was good to get one as a Redskin especially in the Coliseum Its something youll never forget I remember earlier this offseason when you told me that your only concern was winning regardless of your role Were you unsure about how much you were going to play or what your role would be this season I kind of had a feeling that I was going to get a chance to play It was really just talking about special teams whatever they need me to do I know that no matter who they bring in no matter who comes at the end of the day its all competition So I knew if it was competing against ZachBrown Will Compton Martrell Spaight whoever I knew it was going to be a competition I was going to give them my best I know theyre going to give me their best At the end of the day it was about winning If Im giving my best every day and you can beat me out then you deserved it and were going to be alright Thats all it was about Its still the same way Even after the Bye Week all you want to do is win no matter what you got to do You had also mentioned that joining the Redskins made you fall in love with football again Has that love continued to grow this season Definitely You spend four years in Tampa You go to the Bears and get cut Ive never been a quitter and always seen it through to the end but that was like probably the first time in my life where I was probably thinking like I can go do something else How deep did those thoughts go I got cut the last day of camp then probably the next couple of days I had my cousins with me in Chicago and I really was just talking to everybody My best friend from college and my frat brother a strength coach at South Dakota he was like Bruh dont let that stuff get you down Come here you can sleep on my couch well train and it worked out But that was really it those 48 hours where I was just thinking Ill go back to school Im going to go coach Im going to help University of Washington Thats not where my mind should have been at but thats why you have a good circle of friends Your family is there for you all of the time Once I came here Jay and linebackers coach Kirk Olivadotti and all the fellas in the locker room it just made me feel like I love football again Even if I wasnt starting because I started my whole life but it was just being on a team where people cared about you coaches are having fun everybodys playing hard I gravitated towards that It made me want to stay here and continue to help this team win Looking back did it seem silly to have that anxiety Yeah I mean it definitely did because Ive never been that type of person but you kind of felt like some of the stuff that happened in Chicago was a little weird the way the situation played out Its a business and youve just got to keep trucking That was one of the big moments in my career I cant believe I thought for a second that I was done or washed up I still feel like I can play All of my friends my mom my dad everybody close to me was like Bro just go train trust me and it really helped me out Now I know I can do whatever I put my mind to Will Compton reads a lot on psychology and mental training Have you always felt like youve been in a positive mental space too Ive always been super optimistic See the good in people Stay positive How tough is that to do Its pretty tough Especially when you get in those situations like in Chicago That was probably the only time ever Even when I was in Tampa we were 214 I went into every game and thought we were going to beat them by 21 points Thats just how I feel I believe in everyone in this organization wholeheartedly Theyre the best that do their job When I went into that dark thinking maybe Im not as good as I think maybe this isnt for me that was tough because that was the first time I ever really felt like that I had never felt negative about a situation that bad where I wanted to give up It changed a lot of stuff for me I started reading more books What did you read I read the book The Art of Mental Training which was a good way to get your mind on how to eliminate bad thoughts and carry yourself like a champion envision yourself doing this and that That helped me a lot The main thing Im Omega Psi Phi fraternity so both of my line brothers were really on me about You cant let this stuff break you youve got to keep pushing See it through Its really what got me through all of that Youll look at yourself in the mirror and know that you gave it your all You reached out to someone on Twitter and gave him tickets in exchange for community service Has social media been your way to stay positive Definitely Its little way to try and get people to pay it forward I always do that for kids who need tickets or something Just do something nice When youre a good person good things happen to you Thats how my dad raised me Youre a good person good stuff will happen to you sooner or later Its something little but you see it it helps them out a lot I didnt even think about how much it would just pay it forward You be the first one to help them move or hold the door for somebody if people start doing little stuff like that thats the start Thats just the tip of the sword It just gets deeper You can get people to be good people to everybody then you never know what can happen Has it been easier to try since theres been a lot of negativity surrounding players over the last month Its always crazy because most of the guys that I know and I interact with every single day are great guys The best dads I know the best husbands I know the best brothers I know so its crazy that people see NFL players in this crazy light Its part of the game You play a violent sport Sometimes youre going to get viewed that way But I think the stuff people are doing in the community the stuff people do outside of football shows what type of people all these guys are It would be easy just to sit at home and not do anything and turn a blind eye to it I feel like a lot of guys are standing up reaching out into the community and helping out behind closed doors not doing it for any certain reason but to help someone out I think that means a lot to a lot of NFL players Youre a laidback guy too Does that stem from growing up on the west coast Definitely Its probably just from my grandpa My whole family is like that laidback Of course theyre going to be tough on you tough love if you need it and I was one of those hardheaded kids that needed it What was your grandpa like He was real cool We had Grandpa Thursdays This was my dads dad Every Thursday night he would invite everybody over all the grandkids and the cousins Hed cook us all a bunch of food for us to hang out together I feel like he was always helping people out in our neighborhood no matter what My granny my moms parents lived four houses down So we would just bounce around I spent a lot of time with them my mom and dad both worked so my grandpa would pick us up on Fridays Me and my friends it didnt matter who I would be with wed go bowling It pretty much came from that just being a cool person everybody loved my grandpa because of that It was like I could be that too help people out smile listen to people when they need to talk to you It goes a long way for people And living in Seaside Calif and then Seattle those are pretty diverse areas Thats one of the reasons why I fell in in love with Seattle You get the same vibes San Francisco Bay Area Northern California people just chilling Nobodys really judging each other people are just chilling Its pretty cool and its something that I just gravitated towards Im glad I made that decision I wanted to go experience new places Youve lived in the Pacific Northwest the Midwest the Southeast and the Northeast now Do you feel fortunate about living in nearly every time zone and region I love it You never really know how people are Where I grew up theres all different types of people Filipinos Guatemalans Polynesians Samoans so its cool to go to other places and see that everybodys the same but everybodys different Its cool to see everyones variations I love it A lot of people dont get that experience Its cool to meet kids in DC go to the middle schools in Tampa and play basketball with the little kids Which coast has the better food I would say the west coast We just got a certain mix When I was in high school we had Aloha Rallies and multicultural lunches Every culture brought its own food You could just bounce around It was pretty much peoples parents and grandparents cooking Definitely get some egg rolls fried rice I think the west coast just because they have a lot of variety The weather is also so drastically different I cant imagine living in Tampa It doesnt rain as long per day Seattle its just those gray gloomy skies all day Tampa it would rain hard for 10 minutes but then its going to be back to sunny and hot Then the alligators Being in Seattle and then going all the way down to Tampa it was the lockout so I didnt really get to Tampa until camp It was hot There was a bunch of bugs but it just makes you grow up as a person Learn on the run What does the next three quarters of the season look like for you and the team I think its just a continuous climb I think guys know where were at We just want to keep getting better everybody wants to keep getting better You take the Bye Week to really identify look in the mirror see what you did I rewatched all the games see where I can get better Just keep getting better one two three each day is a new day I think people see the potential that we have as a team Now its about making it go happen Nobody likes that shoulda coulda woulda stuff What was your favorite tackle so far It was probably one of those on Monday night Coming off a shoulder injury people never know is he going to be My first play I hit the running back and I was like Im alright So that was a good feeling for me like to really hit somebody Its definitely one Ill remember Is there a certain feeling you have when you know youve made a good tackle Its like hitting the baseball on the sweet spot of the bat You cant even feel it but you know you hit it just right hard enough A good tackle you bring your feet arms he goes backwards Its a great feeling There aint nothing like it I asked Ryan Kerrigan this question and he had a good response Whats the strangest thing youve received unsolicited in the mail from a fan It was something weird for your nose or maybe for your head Some new product It wasnt that weird because I tried it and I mean that might work but I was

interview was edited and condensed', 'One of San Franciscos areas of concentration in recent NFL Draft has been the defensive line where three of the four starts have been selected in the first round of their classes The San Francisco 49ers head into Sundays matchup against the Washington Redskins at 05 but dont let the record fool you there is talent on head coach Kyle Shanahans roster and it starts with the defensive line As it stands on the teams unofficial depth chart the 49ers run a 43 style defense with Solomon Thomas and Arik Armstead manning the two end spots and Earl Mitchell and DeForest Buckner filling out the two interior roles With the size of Armstead and Buckner both listed at 6foot7 the speed and strength of Thomas and the experience of Mitchell this 49ers defensive line is a force to be reckoned with at times They have been impressive man They are young and long and physical really said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden They hit Carson Palmer I dont know how many times about 25 I think They got after Jacoby Brissett pretty good and Goff pretty good They have talent So far this season the group of four has combined for four sacks and one forced fumble while providing constant pressure Maybe the most notable trait of this defensive front is the slew of physical tools at its disposal evidenced by the fact that all but Mitchell are former first round draft picks Thomas a 6foot3 273pound edge defender was one of the premier prospects in this years NFL draft and for good reason The Stanford product ranked in the top five at his position in four exercises bench press broad jump three cone drill and 20 yard shuttle at the NFL Combine this year Buckner and Armstead two tall linemen out of Oregon had the physical attributes to get swooped up in the first round as well with Armstead going at No 17overall in 2015 and Buckner at No 7overall in 2016 They have a really good defense running back Chris Thompson told Redskinscom this week Theyve got length up front a few guys that are 6foot7 So for us were going to really have to be on our reads be patient The line is not short on depth either with fivetime Pro Bowler Elvis Dumervil waiting as the first guy off the bench Filling out the front seven are linebackers Eli Harold Reuben Foster and threetime Pro Bowler NaVorro Bowman Altogether a physically gifted defensive line and a strong core of linebackers make this 49ers defensive front a formidable opponent for the Redskins ground game as well as Kirk Cousins Fortunately for the Redskins their rushing attack has been an integral part of their offense this season Thanks to a hot start from Chris Thompson and solid production from Rob Kelley and Samaje Perine the Redskins enter the weekend averaging 130 rushing yards per game good for seventh best in the NFL With Kelley listed as doubtful for Sunday Thompson and Perine going up against this 49ers defensive front will certainly be a matchup to keep an eye on this weekend', 'Before

Redskins kicked off their 19 th annual Think Pink event raising awareness for breast cancer research while honoring those who have battled the disease Since 1999 the women of Zeta Tau Alpha sorority

Snyder and ZTA continued their tradition Sunday before the Redskins took on the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md The event was part of the NFLs Crucial Catch campaign where teams around the league raise awareness for different types of cancer This is 19 years I am so proud This is a wonderful day Snyder said We have over 300 Zeta volunteers today to share the wonderful milestone event Its incredible so proud When the NFLs Crucial Catch campaign originated a majority of its emphasis was put on breast cancer awareness Entering 2017 the campaign expanded even more to include all types of cancers that have an early detection screening test giving teams around the league options for which cause to support While many NFL teams have chosen to promote other types of cancer research the Redskins decided that breast cancer would remain Washingtons fighting cause Erin Froehlich coordinator for ZTAs involvement in the event said she was glad they decided to stick with breast cancer Its been awesome This is my fifth year coordinating she said Shes such a supporter Shes the one that said Yeah the Redskins are going to do it again this year A lot of other teams

jumped out to a 170 lead against the 49ers before having to stave off a comeback attempt by San Francisco to get a third victory on the year Fourth Quarter Redskins 26 49ers 24 On the first play of the final frame Chris Thompson moved the chains with a 13yard reception on 3 rd and12 The catch means Thompson now has his second career 100yard receiving game The Redskins would eventually get inside the 10yard line but the 16play drive did not result in a touchdown as second and first down runs were stopped before a third down incompletion Dustin Hopkins would make a 21yard field goal though to push the Redskins back into the lead at 2017 The defense meanwhile allowed just one first down before locking down the 49ers offense to force a punt After a short punt return by Jamison Crowder the offense got the ball back with a little more than eight minutes left in the game with the Redskins up by three Cousins would complete his first two passes of the drive before Samaje Perine moved the chains on a 3 rd and1 run Then on Cousins third pass of the drive the quarterback connected with tight end Vernon Davis for a massive 51yard gain that put the Redskins deep into 49ers territory The 49ers then were called for defensive holding to give the Redskins a new set of downs at the sevenyard line which gave Washingtons offense new life On the new set of downs Cousins called his own number on an option run to get the Redskins another touchdown While Hopkins missed his extra point attempt the Redskins now lead by nine The 49ers would match the touchdown though as CJ Beathard found Aldrick Robinson for a 45yard touchdown with less than two minutes left in the game San Franciscos onside kick attempt was caught by Fabian Moreau and Washington would run the ball three times before Tress Way came out to punt with exactly one minute left The ball would go into the end zone for a touchback While the 49ers would get into Redskins territory a late offensive pass interference call pushed San Francisco back to midfield with 19 seconds left After three incompletions the 49ers went for it on 4thand20 with nine seconds left but Kendall Fuller tallied his second interception of the season to close out the game Third Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 17 San Francisco got the ball to start the third quarter but linebacker Ryan Kerrigan prevented the 49ers from getting a second touchdown when he recorded a timely sack on rookie quarterback CJ Beathard Two plays after the takedown by Kerrigan cornerback Kendall Fuller logged a diving pass defensed The 49ers would however tack on a 52yard field goal make to cut the Redskins lead to seven After a brief appearance by the offense Washingtons defense started at midfield following a big punt return by San Francisco The 49ers would miss a 47yard field goal attempt though after getting into Redskins territory On the drive cornerback Bashaud Breeland suffered a knee injury and his return is questionable Rookie Fabian Moreau took his spot in the lineup opposite Quinton Dunbar who replaced an injury Josh Norman for the game The offense would be on the field for just one play though as a Vernon Davis fumble was recovered by the 49ers After just one offensive play for San Francisco Carlos Hyde punched it in for his second touchdown of the game The extra point was good and the game is now tied Kirk Cousins would get the ball moving with an 18yard run on the ensuing drive following the 49ers touchdown Three plays later on 3 rd down Cousins would find an open Ryan Grant in the middle of the field for an 18yard gain to get into San Francisco territory Second Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 7 Working down the field with several short passes from Kirk Cousins to Jordan Reed and Jamison Crowder the Redskins got deep into 49ers territory before the quarterback found rookie Samaje Perine for a threeyard score The catch was the fourthround picks first career touchdown So far on the afternoon Cousins is 12of15 for 121 yards with two touchdown passes San Francisco would get their first positive moment on the afternoon early in the second quarter but Washingtons defense continued to hold stout to force a third punt for as many 49ers offensive drives this afternoon The Redskins couldnt get much going on the ensuing drive as Cousins was off on one pass that was ruled an incompletion before throwing his first interception since Week 1 on an offtarget deep toss down the right sideline After four punts the 49ers went to rookie quarterback CJ Beathard grandson of former Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard to replace Brian Hoyer The Iowa product would complete 1of4 passes on his debut drive before San Francisco called on the punt unit once again Set up by a 49yard screen pass completed to Chris Thompson the Redskins got into field goal range for kicker Dustin Hopkins who nailed a 48yard field goal attempt Thr 49ers though would score just before halftime as Carlos Hyde punched in a oneyard touchdown on 4thandgoal On the drive safety Montae Nicholson was removed from the game after a scary collision with former Redskins wide receiver PierreGaron one that would knock the rookies helmet off First Quarter Redskins 7 49ers 0 Like they did against both the Raiders and the Chiefs the Redskins first offensive drive against the 49ers ended with a touchdown The balanced attack drove 75 yards in just eight plays as Kirk Cousins completed all four of his passes including a touchdown throw to Josh Doctson while the ground game picked up 18 yards This is Doctsons second touchdown catch of the season as he also hauled in a 52yard score against the Raiders in Week 3 Dustin Hopkins extra point was good too as Washington jumped out to an early 70 lead The 49ers meanwhile could not match the Redskins offense as Washington forced San Francisco to punt after gaining just one first down On that drive the 49ers tried to get Pierre Garon on a big second down reception but Bashaud Breeland and Montae Nicholson forced an incompletion Despite the offense getting forced into a threeandout on its next drive the defense continued to show up early in this contest as they also forced a punt after just three plays On a third down dropback by Brian Hoyer Matt Ioannidis and Preston Smith were among those to take down the former Michigan State quarterback It looked like DJ Swearinger later in the quarter had his first career touchdown on a fumble recovery but Hoyers pass was ruled an incomplete pass Quinton Dunbar made sure the 49ers wouldnt get any momentum though as the thirdyear corner who is starting in place of Josh Norman logged a beautiful openfield tackle on third down Terrelle Pryor Sr would record his third catch of the opening frame before the quarter ended', 'X', 'After a strong start the Redskins defense started to bend against the San Francisco 49ers But when it mattered most a banged up secondary made the necessary plays to win the game A win is a win and as safety DJ Swearinger will tell you despite inconsistent play a banged up roster and near devastation thats all that really matters And indeed thats what the Redskins came away with on Sunday afternoon at FedExField beating the San Francisco 49ers 2624 in a game that fluctuated in momentum and emotion Washington began strong lost its grip midway through hung on long enough and then reestablished its hardnosed play with the game on the line and a losing streak to end With less than a minute left and up by two points the Redskins needing the entire list of defensive players to step in and contribute thanks to numerous injuries affecting the secondary once again kept the 49ers from field goal distance in the waning seconds to close out a victory San Franciscos final play a heave towards the sideline with nine seconds left was grabbed by cornerback Kendall Fuller who returned his second career interception a few yards before being mobbed by teammates in celebration solidifying the teams third win after another gutsy performance with a depleted depth chart We know the depth that we have in this secondary Fuller said Everybody can come out there everybody can make plays everybodys smart Thats just how weve got to do it as a group We bend but we dont break Swearinger offered And I told the guys this week in Kansas City we broke We broke I was just putting that out there so that we cant fail again Anytime it is in our hands to win the game weve got to win the game if we want to be a championship defense And we won the game The Redskins entered Sundays contest wellaware of the challenges they were facing Even though the 49ers had begun the year without a victory their talent and lategame energy showed up on tape Washington was also without its star cornerback in Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett needing its backups to play well and stay healthy Much like the teams game against the Chiefs the Redskins preparedness to fill the voids was tested early when Swearinger had to leave the game for a potential stinger The very next play his backup Stefan McClure collided with safety Montae Nicholson and injured his knee and ankle Both eventually returned but it forecasted the kind of day it would be In the third quarter trying to defend a run play 49ers running back Joe Staley made a cut block on cornerback Bashaud Breeland s knee that forced the training staff to help him off the field and he remained sidelined for the game head coach Jay Gruden said afterward he would receive an MRI on MCL on Monday forcing rookie cornerback Fabian Moreau to take over fulltime Without its two best cornerbacks and with San Franciscos offense beginning to find a rhythm with quarterback CJ Beathard who replaced Brian Hoyer in the first half the Redskins had to rely upon a handful of first and secondyear players in the secondary The defense mostly weathered the storm When people go down we still fight Breeland said No matter the changing of the game were still going to fight man I feel like we carry that over next week Itd be good for us Cornerback Quinton Dunbar filling in for Norman led the team with eight tackles and two passes defensed playing tight coverage on wide receiver Pierre Garon throughout and during the crucial waning seconds of the game That was needed after a blown coverage led to a 49ers touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson which cut the lead to two points with just less than two minutes remaining Cornerback Fabian Moreau recovered San Franciscos onside kick but the Redskins offense while it managed to waste the 49ers timeouts couldnt accomplish a first down giving Beathard and co an opportunity to take the lead Throughout the entire week linebacker Zach Brown noted the teams focus on practicing twominute drills and playing under pressure With confidence in a young group of players knowing exactly what it needed to do the defense began to clamp down as the 49ers approached midfield On third down Dunbar batted a pass up in the air that Garon managed to still collect while keeping his knee in bound which was confirmed after review putting the ball at the Redskins 40yard line After an incompletion Beathard targeted Garon again on a slant route that fell incomplete when Brown ran into Garon in coverage That induced a penalty for offensive pass interference a flag that Brown and the defense had anticipated from watching previous games and recognizing the route combination taking shape before the snap I knew the play before it was going to happen Brown said I told DJ Swearinger I said Hey look they may throw it to Pierre Garcon because whenever the tight end is therePierre was cut split so I knew they were going to run a pick and try to give it to Carlos Hyde outside and Garon ran right into me so already knew it was going to be a flag on him because I was guarding my guy I got to have my right of way too I dont blink Dunbar said Like I was saying during the week football is pleasure for me What I went through growing up its fun I just live and play Thats all The play backed up San Francisco to the 50yard line where the defense gained more confidence and stood its ground forcing two consecutive incompletions before Fuller came down with the interception I think they all stepped up Gruden said Youre talking about not a lot of experience back there With Montae Nicholson playing safety Fabian Moreau and you saw Joshua Holsey back there and Kendall Fuller Obviously Quinton Dunbar had a big day today Very impressed with all of them There was a coverage mixup there that gave them a touchdown to get it back to a one or twopoint game but overall I liked the way they competed covered and played It just shows you that even when a star player or a good player goes down weve got the young guys to come in they know what theyre doing theyre going to fill the role Brown said Fuller made a play The defense stood up when it needed to The Redskins kept pace in the division As Swearinger said parts of the game were ugly but the outcome wasnt In a game that needed everyone the Redskins proved everyone was capable Im very confident in all of them linebacker Mason Foster said I practice with them every day I know that if I tell them something if DJ Swearinger tells them something if Zach Brown tells them something theyre going to be on the same page with us like clockwork Of course youre going to have little things messing that up and mistakes but youve just got to keep playing through it and thats what we did I think guys showed their resiliency

zoneread play Its always going to be a part of our offense because it does give defenses something to think about Kyle Shanahan told me when he left he said Ive learned after working with Robert that this is a really valuable play no matter who the quarterback is and Ill always carry it with me So when Jay Gruden arrived we kept it and valued it and as I started playing it can still be a great play You just have to pick your spots be smart with it call it at the right times and read it correctly and then usually you can get some yards The opportunity for that play was set by another balanced attack starting from the Redskins own 16yard line Cousins began the drive with a fouryard pass to tight end Jordan Reed who finished with four catches for 37 yards He then worked a pass to running back Samaje Perine who gained five yards and then rushed for two more to collect a big third down That extended the drive long enough for Davis who ran down the seam wide open and caught a Cousins pass in very similar fashion to the 69yard completion he had against the Chiefs Davis continued to mimic that play with his openfield sprinting across the width of the field for a 52yard gain It was pretty much the same play as Kansas City Davis said Up the seams just run as fast as you possibly can Thats what coach always says just run fast Thats what I was able to do I saw it open went right around the defender and looked up for the ball and Kirk hes great hes good at those and he put it right there Cousins misfired on a designed pumpfake and fade route for Terrelle Pryor Sr from 11 yards deep but gained five yards on the next play with a run from Chris Thompson Cousins then fired a first down to wide receiver Ryan Grant who finished with three catches for 39 yards an indication of their growing trust in each other After a negative rush from Thompson Cousins went back to Grant over the middle but the wide receiver was held by cornerback Kwaun Williams producing an automatic first down From seven yards out Cousins faked a handoff to Perine forcing defensive lineman Solomon Thomas to bite on the play and Cousins scampered into the end zone untouched Ryan Grant had some big third down conversions Vernon had the big play down the seam again A little bit of everybody but it cant happen without the offensive lines protection head coach Jay Gruden said Trent Williams I cant say enough about him playing with the pain that he played in Morgan Moses was beat up a little bit Spencer Long of course Brandon Scherff and those guys and Shawn Lauvao played extremely well It enabled Kirk some time and spread the ball around and got the key points', 'Check out these shots of the Washington Redskins Cheerleaders performing in the 2017 Week 6 matchup vs the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField', 'Even if Taylor Kitsch hadnt starred as dreamboat running back Tim Riggins in the criticallyacclaimed television show Friday Night Lights standing on the Redskins sideline during pregame warmups Sunday at FedExField still would have heightened his athletic instincts Being right on the field gets your blood pumping man I love this said Kitsch whose real expertise is hockey I literally want to pad up even though Id last maybe a quarter of a play Standing beside actor Josh Brolin to promote their latest movie Only The Brave the true story of the Granite Mountain Hotshots an elite crew of firefighters who battled theYarnell Hill Firein 2013 Kitsch had no trouble relating to the fraternal aspects of football Besides the experience of playing on a fictional Texas high school team this new project provided him and Brolin another strong example of the importance in working and communicating effectively as a team Thats everything right Kitsch said If one guy doesnt pull his weight you completely feel that Thats the beauty of it as well that family it really is leaning on one another and having a captain and working all the way down for him Brolin who has been involved in the firefighting community for 30 years and volunteered as a firefighter at one point in his life immediately connected to the brotherhood and camaraderie of an emergency unit Its just a community that I really like a lot Brolin said Wonderfully misfit inappropriate gang that once they get together we talk about bravery especially in the movie the spirit the collective drive these guys have in order to protect the community is really rare Its the common man and woman from all over the place and they come they get together some paradigm changes and theyre able to do what they do They could have easily been describing a football locker room which is maybe why it made sense for their presence on Sunday Besides promoting the movie both actors stood with and honored five Prince Georges County Firefighters during a special onfield presentation during the first quarter I was reading about what they were getting honored by and I actually got all teary in the car because they put themselves in such dangerous situations such unpredictable dangerous situations Brolin said of those being honored Theres no way not to be massively humbled The day before Brolin had spent the entire day walking around the city visiting monuments and memorials and really being able to touch all the historic events and knowing all the storiesit was special Its a special town I like being here he said In fact some of Brolins first football memories involved the nations capital primarily quarterback Doug Williams taking Washington to its second Super Bowl title Brolin remains connected to the team through a friendship with the movies producer Molly Smith daughter of Frederick Smith who is part of the Redskins ownership group We all kind of have this incestuous relationship with football and movies he earlier told NBC Sports Washington Sundays visit to FedExField was the latest stop in their long press tour from Phoenix to California to New York that has afforded both Brolin and Kitsch sobering encounters with countless firefighters and their families It was informative before the filming of the movie and deeply humbling after it Thats why we came on We were flattered to be a part of it and I think thats one of the best things that we do is that we get to serve and tell these stories that otherwise would never be exposed Kitsch said The movie is also being released at a time when devastating forest fires have spread through much of California and killed dozens Both Kitsch and Brolin hope that Only The Brave can bring more awareness for the heroic men and women exhibiting their courageousness during these natural disasters It brings awareness Brolin said Those guys arent going to come out so Im happy to exploit them happy to exploit how wonderful they are and how much they deserve our respect at every level As he looked at his surroundings Kitsch wearing a customized No 19 Redskins jersey representing the amount of firefighters that passed away in the firefight they depicted couldnt help but pull a football metaphor Its very similar to all these guys with the Redskins the team Kitsch said When the game is on its just them Everything else is gone and when something happens its just them out there You have to lean on people Added Brolin All you have is each other Only The Brave hits theaters nationwide on Oct 20', 'EASY TWEET RedskinsCR

injuries of their own The Washington Redskins may be without three more key players for next Mondays game against the Philadelphia Eagles as head coach Jay Gruden announced on Monday that defensive linemen Jonathan Allen Lisfranc sprain could be out three to four weeks while kicker Dustin Hopkins right hip rotator muscle strain is weektoweek Cornerback Bashaud Breeland knee sprain could be limited some this week too but Gruden believes theres a chance he could still play against the Eagles Allen the teams firstround pick in the 2017 NFL Draft suffered the foot injury in the fourth quarter of Sundays 2624 victory over the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md The 22yearold has started all five games for the Redskins so far this season recording 10 tackles with one sack He posted a careerhigh four tackles in his NFL regular season debut against the Philadelphia Eagles before tallying his first professional sack against the Oakland Raiders in Week 3 Against the 49ers on Sunday Allen appeared on 29 defensive plays before being removed from the game The Redskins will call on secondyear Alabama AM product Anthony Lanier II to see an increase in playing time in place of Allen While Lanier has yet to suit up in any regular season games so far this season he appeared in four games during his rookie season and recorded a fumble recovery against the Cincinnati Bengals Gruden even said during the offseason that Lanier has the chance to be an impact player if an opportunity presented itself for the 24yearold to take the field He was a guy that was one of the most difficult for our guys to block Gruden said He was not a very natural rusher either He was doing it on pure power length And I think the more he works coming out of his stance getting off on the snap count hand usage all the things Coach Jim Tomsula worked with him I think hes got a chance to be really really good Breeland meanwhile went down with his knee injury in the third quarter after 49ers tackle Joe Staley rolled up on his leg With Quinton Dunbar already replacing an injured Josh Norman in the starting lineup the Redskins called upon rookie thirdround pick Fabian Moreau to step in for Breeland The UCLA product appeared on 34 defensive plays Seventhround pick Joshua Holsey also received action on defense on the 49ers last drive of the game I think they all stepped up Gruden said Sunday of the young defensive backs Youre talking about not a lot of experience back there With Montae Nicholson playing safety Fabian and you saw Holsey back there and Kendall Fuller Obviously Dunbar had a big day today Very impressed with all of them There was a coverage mixup there that gave them a touchdown to get it back to a one or twopoint game but overall I liked the way they competed covered and played Gruden said Monday that Breeland has always been a fast healer leaving open the possibility that he could still suit up in Philadelphia Hes like Gumby Gruden said with a smile He took a pretty big shot on that play and I thought he was going to be out for a little bit of time but he recovers quickly Hopkins meanwhile has been the Redskins kicker since being signed following the 2015 regular season opener In his twoplus seasons with the Redskins Hopkins has converted on 68of81 field goal attempts along with 87of92 extra points Hes also averaged nearly 63 yards per kickoff during that span So far this season the Florida State product has been successful on 9of11 field goal tries and 12of13 extra points Gruden said the team will work out some kickers on

here In a 2624 victory over the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md Cousins finished the afternoon completing 25of37 passes for 330 yards with two touchdowns and a passer rating of 1023 It was the 21 st time that Cousins has passed for 300 yards a franchise record and the third consecutive game in which the Pro Bowler has posted a quarterback rating of 100 or better On Washingtons first drive of the game Cousins completed all four of his pass attempts including an 11yard touchdown to secondyear wide receiver Josh Doctson Then in the second quarter Cousins connected with Samaje Perine on a threeyard touchdown pass on 3 rd and1 Cousins also ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter a scamper that would turn out to be the gamewinning score I think we did a good job as an offense Cousins said I think we moved the football There were a lot of good decisions a lot of good plays made a lot of thirddown conversions in big moments a lot of crucial drives where we had to churn the clock and come away with points So I was proud of the way our offense played It wasnt perfect there were a couple mistakes but all in all we did a lot of good things Cousins is up against Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz and Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer although neither toppled 300 passing yards like Washingtons quarterback did', 'A morning roundup of what

Look Around The League', 'Kirk Cousins cut through San Franciscos defense through the air and on the ground in an allaround performance from Washingtons starting quarterback Three quarterbacks started during the Washington Redskins 2624 victory over the San Francisco 49ers Of the three it was Redskins signal caller Kirk Cousins that looked the most deserving of his leadership role The 49ers went through two quarterbacks Brian Hoyer and CJ Beathard but neither could not match the efficiency of Cousins Washingtons sixthyear passer started the game like a veteran going 4of4 with a touchdown pass to receiver Josh Doctson on the opening drive Cousins who finished the game with 330 passing yards his second highest total of the season remained his own worst critic after the game I think we did a good job as an offense Cousins said It wasnt perfect there were a couple mistakes but all in all we did a lot of good things The largest missteps in his game came during the second quarter on two questionable throws On second down Cousins fired deep for tight end Jordan Reed but missed by a wide margin Jimmie Ward went horizontal and barely grabbed the interception but after some deliberation the referees ruled the pass incomplete Crisis averted On the very next pass Cousins again looked deep this time for tight end Vernon Davis Again the ball sailed past its mark and landed in the hands of a 49ers defender Cornerback Rashard Robinson tiptoed in bounds with the ball secured cutting Washingtons drive short I thought he played efficient said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden He had the one pick on thirdandlong It was bad play design by us but it was like a punt so it didnt hurt us at all Cousins made up for the missed throw to Davis by throwing a laser that ended with the 33year old tight end sprinting 51 yards to the San Francisco 22yard line The offense slowly crept up to the goal line before Gruden called in readoption Cousins yanked the ball from running back Samaje Perine s arms and took it himself barely missing the crashing defensive end before reaching the end zone Cousins who ran a handful of options in the game finished as the teams second leading rusher with 26 yards on four carries Gruden admitted that those types of play calls are not his favorite I dont love it but I do like it It gets the numbers back in your favor a little bit Gruden said Obviously Kirk is not exactly the readoption quarterback that you would be looking for if you were looking for a readoption quarterback but hes very effective at it You know those are huge plays for us When Cousins wasnt taking off down the field he was playing with confidence and poise often wisely checking down to the safest option to avoid further turnovers Running back Chris Thompson one of Cousins favorite checkdowns ended up as the teams leading receiver with 105 yards on four receptions Perine also made an impact in the passing game taking a checkdown in the red zone three yards for his first career touchdown Of the receivers Cousins favored fourthyear Ryan Grant With three catches and 39 yards Cousins said he was excited to get Grant and the other receivers more involved in the passing game There are times when I can keep watching the film and Ill go back and feel like he couldve caught two or three more passes but I didnt do a good job of getting him the football Cousins said He has all the tools and now in his fourth year theres a lot of confidence and experience there so hes going to keep getting better as well', 'After a rookie season in which he saw few reps secondyear defensive linemen Matt Ioannidis is thriving in 2017 He currently paces the team in quarterback pressureshits Coming off of a rookie season in which he struggled to get significant playing time and even began his debut campaign on the practice squad Matt Ioannidis has looked like a new player so far in this 2017 campaign The defensive lineman continued his hot start to the season in Week 6 logging 15 sacks and combining for three tackles in Sundays win against the San Francisco 49ers After being selected in the fifth round of the 2016 NFL Draft Ioannidis was initially waived by the Redskins prior to his rookie season but signed with the practice squad a day later The former Temple Owl got the call to the 53man roster following an injury to Kedric Golston during the 2016 regular season but did not record much of a stat line in his limited playing time This year has been a completely different story Through the first five games of the 2017 season Ioannidis has made two starts the first two of his career recorded 35 sacks and has already eclipsed his 2016 mark of eight combined tackles with 10 this year His 43 quarterback pressureshits according to coaches stats are 14 more than any other player on the active roster As it stands following the 49ers game he is tied for second on the team in sacks with veteran Ryan Kerrigan I think the guys around me have been helping me develop a lot as a player and Coach Tomsula its been a lot of things Ioannidis said of his progression So far this season Ioannidis has recorded at least a share of a sack in four of his five games played Ioannidis biggest play against the 49ers came on a key 3rdand5 snap from the Redskins 20yard line With less than five minutes to go in the third quarter the 49ers had already scored 10 unanswered to start the second half and were threatening to tie the game down 1710 Thats when Ioannidis was able to come up with a clutch sack on rookie San Francisco quarterback CJ Beathard for an eightyard loss which might have even contributed to Robbie Gould missing a 47yard field goal a play later The play proved to be crucial in a game that was decided by just two points It was a good win a good hardfought battle on both sides of the ball and Im really proud of this team Ioannidis said after the game Defensively I think we all played cohesively as one unit and thats something that weve done in the past and were continuing to do The 23yearold has been one of the surprise pieces of a defensive line that needed to show its depth immediately when Phil Taylor went down in Week 1 Since the injury to Taylor the coaching staff has called upon young guys like Ioannidis and Jonathan Allen to help fill the void I think its been great Ioannidis said of the depth of this defensive line Guys like Terrell McClain and Stacy McGee and Jonathan Allen and Ziggy Hood they do a great job and Im just benefitting from having those guys around One of the contributing factors to Ioannidis success this year too has been the fact hes in a more comfortable position After briefly being considered a nose tackle option last year hes now playing defensive end He is playing some threetechnique in nickel getting some opportunities to rush where he didnt get that last year said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden He mainly was a base player playing the run Now he is actually in sub packages rushing the passer So he is getting more opportunities', 'The Redskins Charitable Foundation kicked off their 10 th annual AllStar Survivors Celebration for some of the bravest women battling and beating cancer in Washington For

just do little things like this to know that they have our support Way said They get to feel and look beautiful and just have fun Way spent his time checking out the head scarves and wigs After seeing his wife receive a heart shape colored into her hair he decided to sport the look as well claiming he would swear off showering to keep the color in as long as possible Way also took a turn at the makeup table along with Mack Brown Brown came away with bright pink lipstick while Way went with the smokyeyed look Many of the women said the tours of the locker room led by the players were their favorite parts of the day As Redskins fans they said it was incredible to see behind the scenes of the team they cheer on every Sunday To see them inside of our locker room theyre just so enamored by it and I think thats really cool Way said As long as we can do that and just show them a good time today I think thats a cool escape to have some fun Barbara Vivian one of the survivors invited to the

own toughness Thank you so much for being here Thank you so much for fighting I know its hard Dont quit You guys are really role models for the way you battle Your husbands your sons your daughters

playing in Sundays game against the 49ers seemed dubious at best He hadnt practiced for nearly two weeks thanks to the bye and his knee which he injured against the Chiefs was still giving him pain But if theres one thing to learn from Williams seven years in the league its to never count him out Though he was close to sitting out the teams 2624 victory Williams made what head coach Jay Gruden called a valiant effort playing in 73 of the offenses 74 snaps showing off his resiliency at a time when multiple Redskins are out with injury I felt average Williams said of his play I didnt necessarily feel like myself but thats expected I havent done anything with football in the last two weeks I felt rusty It was kind of hard early trying to fight through the rust and everything but once you start getting in the flow of the game and the adrenaline starts rushing you kind of start to worry about the game more than anything Williams said once he made the decision to play his mindset began to change which helped him to focus on the competition in front of him and not the pain and rust from the previous week of sitting out Once you accept the fact that youre going to be going through pain its not so normal Williams said I already knew it was going to be pretty tough but everybody out here is fighting theres no excuse for me not to Williams allowed just one sack to defensive lineman Solomon Thomas the only sack of the day and played a role in extending a drive in the first half when he recovered a Chris Thompson fumble Without swing tackle Ty Nsekhe healthy tackle TJ Clemmings had been preparing all week to start if he was called upon but Williams stepped up Its always going to be hard especially when you go through a week with no practice Williams said of finding the groove again Mental rest can do a lot for you mentally but you need the rest physically especially with offensive linemen What we do we get in a rhythm and youve got to steadily tweak things here and there so not having practice makes it very tough That didnt mean Williams wasnt critical of himself or the team Weve got some things to clean up Willaims said We can be a lot better Weve got to cut the turnovers down and the penalties We couldve knocked them around but we fought through We definitely came away with three points sometimes when we shouldve had seven but it is what it is Well watch film and make corrections When asked if Williams would have played had Nsekhe been available Gruden hypothesized that he still would have been in the starting lineup Sunday was another example of Williams leadership and dedication to the team knowing the importance of the game in setting the tone for the rest of an important week preparing for the firstplace Eagles He played

season 83 and defeating the Chicago Bears in the NFL Championship October 8 1944 Tie 3131 It took six years and 11 straight losses for Philadelphia to claw its way back into the rivalry After making backtoback trips the NFL Championship in 1942 and 1943 the Redskins regressed from their usual NFL East domination Eagles quarterback Roy Zimmerman gave his team the biggest lead of the day finding

years series during their eightgame winning streak against the Redskins and ended the season 92 beating the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Championship November 24 th 1957 Eagles win 2112 In 1957 the

Eagles and Redskins took part in one of the most famous trades in NFL history Philadelphia sent Jurgensen to Washington in exchange for Snead and cornerback Claude Crabb When Jurgensen first met his former team on the field it was obvious who got the better end of the deal Washingtons new quarterback threw for 385 yards and five touchdowns After jumping out to a 210 lead the Redskins took their foot off the gas and allowed the Eagles to creep back into the game In the third quarter Philadelphia quarterback Timmy Brown broke through the line on a fiveyard score bringing the score to 2820

football The AFL and NFL merged and the following season would determine which teams would compete for the very first Super Bowl A 33 start for the Redskins meant a win against the Eagles would be crucial if the team wanted to make the onegame playoff Both teams got off to a slow start trading field goals for the first three quarters At the start of the final quarter the game was tied at 13 Jurgensen saved the day with two touchdown passes to Mitchell and Jerry Smith November 7 1971 Tie 77 Washington started the 1971 season 50 on its way to its first playoff berth in the Super Bowl Era Halfway through the season the Redskins had just one loss and were looking towards a firstplace finish in the NFC East The Eagles foiled those plans in a brutal defensive game Quarterback Billy Kilmer

a win The Redskins later lost in the divisional round of the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers October 8 1972 Redskins win 237 After the tie in 1971 Washington went on to beat Philadelphia

survive Mitchell did his best to keep Washington competitive but the wounded team was eventually overwhelmed and lost 2814 January 5 1991 Redskins win 206 The Body Bag Game would be the second of three meetings between the Redskins and Eagles in the 1990 season The third came in the first round of the playoffs the only postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals Far from explosive the Redskins steadily cut down the Eagles early lead scoring 20 unanswered points to move on to the Divisional Round before eventually winning the Super Bowl September 19 th 1993 Eagles win 3431 The Eagles looked to be on the rise in their third straight win of 1993 Neither team gained an edge in the first three quarters with the score being tied with a little more than nine minutes left in the game An 85yard run by Reggie Brooks put Washington up 3124 and it looked like the Redskins would earn the W but a late filed goal put the Eagles within striking distance With four seconds left quarterback Randall Cunningham found Calvin Williams for a 10yard touchdown winning the game for Philadelphia November 28 1999 Redskins win 2017 OT Rookie Donovan McNabb had already stolen a win against the Redskins two weeks before McNabbs first trip to Washington ended with the rookie recording 243 yards of total offense The Redskins jumped out to a 10point lead but McNabb threw two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to tie things up at 17 The Redskins staved off the Eagles behind the leg of Brett Conway on a 27yard field goal in overtime November 6 2005 Redskins win 1710

against Washington during the first half of the 2000s The Redskins finally snapped the streak one year after the Eagles reached the Super Bowl After Washington snatched a 1710 lead the Eagles offense stalled in the fourth quarter The Redskins defense ended any hope for a McNabb comeback when Ryan Clark came down with an interception with less than three minutes left in the game November 18 2012 Redskins win 316 The 2012 season ended unexpectedly for Washington After drafting quarterback Robert Griffin III with the secondoverall pick the Redskins went 36 before their Week 10 bye A matchup with a 36 Eagles team was exactly what Washington needed to jumpstart the season The defense overpowered quarterback Nick Foles who was picked off twice and fumbled three times Meanwhile Griffin threw for 200 yards and four touchdowns without an interception and ran for an additional 84 yards Washington ended the regular season with seven straight wins reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2007 December 20 2014 Redskins win 2724 Washington helped foil Philadelphias plans for the postseason with a close win late in the year Surprisingly fullback Darrel Young carried the Redskins offense with two rushing touchdowns With five seconds remaining in the game kicker Kai Forbath nailed the gamewinner form 26 yards out Receiver DeSean Jackson recorded his first win over his former team after

fourinterception game in Chicago Maybe it was because his family was in the stadium or maybe because Bears quarterback Jay Cutler just enjoyed throwing his way Whatever the case cornerback DeAngelo Hall had a career game in Chicago one of the greatest in NFL history Seven years ago on Oct 24 at Soldier Field Hall put on a show at cornerback intercepting four passes in the second half tying a leaguehigh mark and returning one of them 92 yards for a score en route to a Redskins 1714 victory Hall could barely realize what he accomplished after the game Its kind of mind blowing he said I had my mom my aunt and my two cousins in the stands The first ball went to my mom the second ball went to my aunt and the next thing you knew everybody had a ball The highlight of the day and the play that gave the Redskins a lead they would hold onto for good came with Washington trailing 1410 in the third quarter The Bears were driving and reached the Redskins 13yard line Forced under pressure Cutler made a throw off his back foot to the right sideline where Hall jumped in front of Johnny Knox to make a spectacular onehanded catch But he wasnt done sprinting down the sideline into the end zone London Fletcher called it the sickest interception he had ever seen Halls three other interceptions were also impressive His first one was a diving stab in front of Devin Hester His third came deep in Bears territory where he nabbed an offtarget pass The fourth and final pick came with just more than two minutes left in the game when Hall leaped for a deep ball that was overthrown Theres no reason to shy away from him Cutler said afterward saving face I mean thats hard for me to say throwing four picks to the guy but I still think if we had to play him tomorrow Id go after him every time Im sure Hall would have relished the opportunity For one of the few times in his life wide receiver Art Monk was nervous before an NFL game On the eve of the Redskins Monday Night Football matchup with the Broncos at RFK Stadium Monk knew he had the opportunity to break the NFL receptions record He wanted to get it out of the way and so did the Redskins who faced the Eagles the next week and wanted Monks attention and the teams attention on their division rival For a moment on that Oct12 night it looked as though the record would have to wait The Redskins were crushing the Broncos and throwing the ball wasnt particularly practical as the fourth quarter ran down But head coach Joe Gibbs pressed on He called three pass plays in a row for the eventual Hall of Famer during a final fourth quarter drive The third pass was the recordsetter a 10yard throw from Mark Rypien that Monk caught by the Broncos sideline with just more than three minutes left to play The reception made history pushing past Steve Largent and Monk was quickly lifted into the air by his teammates to celebrate I knew it was for the record It was a play designed for me to catch Monk said after the Redskins eventual 343 victory Im glad its over I was nervous before the gamethats something Im not used to I was glad to be able to do it here With the game in hand those that didnt leave early for traffic were rewarded for their patience and roared for their wide receiver Monk finished the night with seven catches for 69 yards and would finish his career with 940 receptions now 17 th overall on

capitalize and keep the momentum going in the second half letting San Francisco back into the game Cousins could sense the shifting tides on the sideline speaking with quarterbacks coach Kevin OConnell Sometimes I get in a weird place with a lead like this to where you start playing conservative and not to lose and its smart to do that but it also kind of hinders your ability to just go

matchup with the Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field JWallMVP asks knowing that we lost to the Eagles 1st game of the season now going back to Philly what are the main keys The Redskins are seeking to exact revenge on their NFC East rivals after the Eagles scored a 3017 Week 1 victory at FedExField in Landover Md and it could come down to the quarterback play While Philadelphia struggled to run the ball against Washingtons defense quarterback Carson Wentz made the unit pay multiple times by extending plays On the defenses opening drive of the season it looked as if the Redskins were ready to record a massive third down sack Instead Wentz escaped two different Redskins to launch a 58yard bomb for a touchdown After the game the Redskins spoke of the frustration of not getting Wentz down but admitted theyd learn from their mistakes from not taking down the secondyear quarterback Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays said linebacker Mason Foster at the time We were right there We will go look at it and get it corrected and just keep getting better and try to make this the last one like that Wentzs hot start has extended through the first month and a half of the season as he enters Mondays game with 13 touchdowns to just three interceptions while passing for more than 1500 yards So stopping the quarterback wont be easy especially with uncertainty in the defensive backfield It isnt clear yet whether cornerbacks Josh Norman rib and Bashaud Breeland knee will play Itll be a great challenge because hes playing extremely well said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Theyre 51 for a reason and hes a major part of that Hes got a great rapport with the receivers right now Theyre playing at a high level so our guys will have to step up Thats just the way it is Theres a lot of teams around the National Football League this time of the year that are dealing with key injuries at certain positions and we just had a couple of them at the corner spot So Fabian Moreau Quinton Dunbar theyll have to step up and play well Joshua Holsey Kendall Fuller While Wentz had a strong showing the opener Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins struggled He had three turnovers including two crucial mistakes in the fourth quarter First Cousins threw an interception in the red zone on third down at a time when the Redskins were only trailing by two points Then after the defense held the Eagles to a field goal late the Redskins had an opportunity to win the game with less than two minutes left trailing by only five But on a 2 nd and3 dropback from Cousins the quarterback had the ball jarred from his possession The Eagles grabbed his fumble and turned it into a touchdown Since that performance though Cousins has been among the best quarterbacks in the league Hes thrown eight touchdowns to just one interception in Washingtons last four games Cousins has also been able to keep opposing defenses on their toes by dispersing the ball to multiple targets Six different Redskins have at least 11 receptions on the season I think any time we have a route combination I think he trusts everybody involved in the pattern and hes seeing things pretty clearly getting to his right reads and right progressions Gruden said this week Its all about reading the defenses going through your progressions and the line giving him time and then trusting the guys to make the plays for you Grimm asks hailmail fatrob a go We wont know Rob Kelley s game status until Saturday afternoon when the Redskins complete the week of practices but Gruden did say this week that the running back will return practice after not participating at all last week Kelley of course did not play in last Sundays victory over the San Francisco 49ers as he still wasnt quite at full strength In his place the Redskins once again relied on the combination of Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson The two running backs combined for 56 rushing yards on 25 carries while Kirk Cousins chipped in 26 rushing yards and a score on the ground as well Perine also scored his first NFL touchdown on a threeyard reception from the quarterback Kelley has been slowed by rib and ankle injuries so far this year as he did not play against either the 49ers or Oakland Raiders He was also removed from games against the Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs as well So the only game hes been fully healthy in this year was the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles His return though could help a Redskins offense thats going against the leagues No 1 rush defense as the Eagles allow just 657 yards on the ground per game Thats nearly five yards less than any other team in the NFL The Eagles havent allowed any running backs to come close to 100 yards on the ground and limited the Carolina Panthers running backs to just one yard on 13 carries last week Now if Kelley cant play on Monday night Gruden remains confident that Perine can be effective in the Tulane products place After not recording a single offensive snap in Washingtons first game against Philadelphia Perine has recorded 55 carries for 166 yards over the Redskins last four contest The more opportunities he gets the better he is going to get Gruden said He is not a finished product by any stretch He is a rookie He is feeling himself through it but I am just looking for more decisive cuts by him and more physical runs Thats just what we expect from Samaje and I know he expects that himself', 'The 14year veteran safety practiced for the first time

his potential return Halls addition to the active roster could also help some of the cornerbacks as well where the Redskins have two rookies The Virginia Tech product of course played the position for a majority of his career at the position before making a fulltime switch to safety last year Hes kind of been a mainstay here and he kind of keeps the boat from sinking from time to time said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden during training camp Theres some volatile people in that defensive back room from time to time and hes a calming guy if you can believe that DHall is Hes been great Hes been a great leader for us Unfortunately for him injuries have shortened his season Hopefully well be able to get him back at a later date but if we dont have him back when we want to at least hell be in the room and still have a major influence on the team and the defense If activated Hall wants to prove that he has a lot left in the tank at an age when most of his peers have already left in the game I

Jay Gruden He mainly was a base player playing the run Now he is actually in sub packages rushing the passer So he is getting more opportunities As for Lanier the 2016 college free agent signing out of Alabama AM has yet to appear in a regular season game this year But the team has high hopes for the 6foot6 286 pounder especially after an offseason in which he packed on more than 15 pounds to his frame He is a lot stronger and thats a good thing Gruden said Hes a small college guy and he came in and got some experience last year and then hopefully parlays that on to a good strong preseason and training camp We will see how it translates on game day He will be a part of the rotation not just on third down He might have to play some early downs He is a guy that hopefully is getting better not just at rushing the passer but playing the run Francis returned to the Redskins on Wednesday as a practice squad addition before being signed to the 53man roster The Washington DC native split time

not play on Monday night against the Eagles This weeks injury report is brought to you by Inova the Official Health System of the Washington Redskins The Washington Redskins will head into Monday nights divisional matchup with the Philadelphia Eagles with cornerback Bashaud Breeland knee safeties Deshazor Everett hamstring and Stefan McClure knee linebacker Mason Foster shoulder running back Rob Kelley ankle and tackle Trent Williams knee as questionable However Washington will be without one of its starting cornerbacks along with two backup offensive linemen as Josh Norman rib Ty Nsekhe core muscle and Tyler Catalina concussion have all been ruled out The starting corner tandem of Breeland and Norman was limited throughout the weeks practices as Washington will be shorthanded at the position against Philadelphias bevy of wide receivers that includes Nelson Agholor Alshon Jeffrey and Torrey Smith Breeland injured his knee in the second half of last weeks 2624 victory over the San Francisco 49ers While the Clemson product was unable to finish the game Redskins head coach Jay Gruden believes theres a chance hell be able to play based on history of quick recoveries from injuries I think Breelands always been a fast healer Hes like Gumby Gruden said this week I mean he took a pretty big shot on that play and I thought he was going to be out for a little bit of time but he recovers quickly As for Norman the former AllPro returned to practice this week after being inactive for the 49ers game He originally suffered a rib fracture in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs Quinton Dunbar replaced him in the starting lineup and appeared on 64 defensive plays against San Francisco recording eight tackles with two passes defensed With Norman once again being ruled out the Redskins will look to Dunbar along with rookie Fabian Moreau to fill the void The Eagles are playing at a high level so our guys will have to step up Gruden said Thats just the way it is Theres a lot of teams around the National Football League this time of the year that are dealing with key injuries at certain positions and we just had a couple of them at the corner spot So Fabian Dunbar theyll have to step up and play well Offensively the Redskins could return Rob Kelley to the starting running back position Kelley also did not play against the 49ers after suffering his ankle injury against the Chiefs The Tulane product has been banged up throughout this season as hes been inactive twice and also been unable to play in the second quarter of two other contests If Kelley needs another week of recovery the Redskins will rely on Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine as the main contributors at the position Thompson of course is in the midst of a breakout season as he currently leads the team in both receiving 340 yards and rushing 175 yards Perine meanwhile has recorded 55 carries for 166 yards While the rookies numbers dont pop out through his first five NFL games the coaching staff has confidence that hell improve down the stretch He is not a finished product by any stretch He is a rookie He is feeling himself through it but I am just looking for more decisive cuts by him and more physical runs Gruden said Thats just what we expect from Samaje and I know he expects that himself As for Williams the Pro Bowl tackle gutted out a complete game against San Francisco as he appeared on all but one offensive play despite not practicing at all last week Even though Williams once again wasnt 100 percent this week hes set a standard of playing through injuries Once you accept the fact that youre going to be going through pain its not so normal Williams said last week I already knew it was going to be pretty tough but everybody out here is fighting theres no excuse for me not to', 'The Redskins signed kicker Nick Rose who has yet to appear in an NFL game before to replace Dustin Hopkins The University of Texas product is hoping to make good on his situation New Redskins kicker Nick Roses goals for Thursday were pretty simple have a good first day of practice and purchase some socks Called in earlier this week for a tryout with three other kickers after the team placed kicker Dustin Hopkin on Injured Reserve with a hip muscle injury Rose made all of his kicks and according to head coach Jay Gruden made solid contact on kickoffs It was enough for Washington to sign him but Rose was unprepared for any kind of extended stay bringing just a backpack a couple of Tshirts and a pair of shorts They actually hooked me up with a rental today Rose said I didnt really know much coming in to this They kept a lot of things under closed doors Once he gets some more clothes to wear hell have as tall a task as any kicker thats preparing for his first official NFL game The Redskins visit Philadelphia for Monday Night Football a dramatic spotlight to make a debut especially for a kicker Everybody wants to know about kickers and pressure Rose said I feel like how you handle your own pressure is what it comes down to I put a lot of pressure on myself every day for every kick so I feel like its no different in a gametype situation As far as pressure goes I feel like I handle that pretty well Expectation is expectation Everybody expects you to make every single kick Is that realistic No Its your job to make as many of them as you can and to make the ones that count A former walkon at the University of Texas Rose spent four years with the Longhorns appearing in all 51 games He finished his career hitting 27of38 field goals and 71of74 extra points finishing with 152 points He signed with the Falcons in May last year but was waived at the end of training camp The 49ers signed him to a ReserveFuture contract this past January but he was let go during the final roster cutdown in September In the meantime Rose was back in Austin training with weights and using Texas facility He said he never gave up on his dream of being a kicker despite the disappointment of being released twice hoping that an opportunity would approach again This has been a dream of mine for a long time so I was 100 percent committed to it always training always staying ready and just ready for an opportunity honestly Rose said You never know how the business or what organization is looking for what You dont know if an opportunity is going to come youve just got to be ready for it when it is Rose had made impressions after college with some trick shot videos he posted on social media namely one in which he made an 80yard field goal Since then hes realized that kicking the ball the furthest isnt too important when it comes to being consistent from less than 50 yards out He will likely have a few opportunities this Monday night aiming to make good on all of his patience I feel like life is kind of a rollercoaster Rose said This is just part of it I guess Its part of the path I chose I wake up every day and make the decision to be a kicker and thats kind of the path you have to take Thats never going to be one way or another Everybody kind of has their own route This happened to be mine and this is my opportunity', 'One of the most improved units on the Redskins the defensive line lost a crucial part of its rotation with Jonathan Allen s recent injury Theyll need to fill the void against the firstplace Eagles Arguably the biggest upgrade to the Redskins defense this season has been the defensive line The unit underwent a reboot this past offseason bringing in two free agent veterans in Stacy McGee and Terrell McClain and making its biggest splash in the draft selecting Jonathan Allen in the first round The emergence of Matt Ioannidis in his second year has helped transform the pass rush and produced a ripple effect for the rest of the defense The depth and talent of the line will be tested this Monday night in a primetime matchup with the Eagles however now that Allen will be gone for at least eight weeks of the season The Redskins placed him on Injured Reserve with a Lisfranc injury that he suffered against the 49ers last Sunday and will have to lean on others to fill the void We miss a guy thats willing to communicate with you and willing to get better an unselfish guy and able to take coaching and get better and understand his role and job out there especially when it comes to the field and stuff like that defensive lineman Ziggy Hood said The Redskins feared that Allen could be lost for the entire season because injuries to the Lisfranc can be extremely difficult to rehab especially for a 288pound lineman He could be eligible to return Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals We got better news after the surgery that it wouldnt be as lengthy as some of these surgeries typically are So thats good news but we still have to rehab it head coach Jay Gruden said He is a big man and sometimes bigger guys take a little bit longer but we will wait and see We will just play it by ear and hopefully we see him again but it is up to the rehab The Redskins will likely lean on secondyear defensive lineman Anthony Lanier II who has been on the 53man roster for the entire season but has been inactive for all five games He played in four games last season year before an injury sidelined him for the rest of the year and he will have a daunting task facing an Eagles team that ranks in the Top10 in nearly every offensive category most notably they lead the league in third down conversions Very excited Lanier said of his opportunity You know keeping the pressure on Wentz is going to be big for us so getting everybody together and lets go do this Its bad that we had to lose Allen but we have got a lot of guys on the roster that are going to fill that spot defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said It is not going to fill it totally like Allen would but Anthony has been doing a pretty good job We are going to mix in and out different guys to see what those guys have But Lanier has been improving each and every week and we are looking forward to him getting on the field and playing the game Beside each other Ioannidis and Allen have been sparkplugs for the pass rush creating an interior push that forced quarterbacks to either flee the pocket or get swarmed by outside linebackers Thats also meant that the team has been able to rely on less blitzing letting the secondary stay in coverage and linebackers keeping an eye on running backs and tight ends The Redskins have 15 sacks on the season and they rank 11 th in the league with a 79 adjusted sack rate percentage which factors in sacks per pass attempt adjusted for down distance and opponents according to Football Outsiders Allen was a big factor in those numbers creating pushes and stunts that freed up his teammates to attack the quarterback According to Pro Football Focus Allen leads all defensive tackles with a 131 pass rush productivity mark for players with at least 30 pass rushes Hes also reached 13 quarterback pressures the most of any rookie defensive tackle on just 80 snaps Gruden remains confident in his potential replacements including AJ Francis who the team recently signed to the active roster after he was cut before the regular season Lanier is a different animal Hes a good pass rusher still young Gruden said Francis provides us some more depth as far as the interior as far as nose guard is concerned I dont know which combination we will use come Monday but it is good to get AJ back here We liked him a lot We let him go numberswise and then we are fortunate that he was on the streets so we brought him back The Redskins underneath defensive line coach Jim Tomsula have rotated their defensive line enough this season to the point that everyone has remained fresh throughout the course of games This should continue to help them in chasing down Wentz on Monday night taking more strides as a unit This room is full with a bunch of guys that arent selfish thats willing to put away egos aside play different positions that they normally dont play whether thats me playing nose Terrell McClain playing that fourtechnique and big Stacy McGee playing the fourtechnique and stuff like that Hood said So we got guys doing that are willing to fight for the guy next to him You want to push them to allow them to be better Then youve got a bunch of guys that are willing to do anything to win', 'With the

Allen 7 He has all the ability in the world and hes capable of doing the same job if not better And we believe that hes going to have a good game this game because we trust in him and are going to be behind him each step of the way Defensive lineman Ziggy Hood on how Anthony Lanier II will fill in for Jonathan Allen 6 I think me getting all the carries I think it wouldnt benefit the team especially at this point Youve got Chris Thompson playing out of his mind right now Why would you do that But whatever coach needs Im there for If you need me to run the ball the whole time I can run

been on PUP so I kind of didnt know really what to expect But its definitely given my body a chance to really heal I felt like I probably could have been back a lot earlier but I think sound advice

like the Philadelphia Eagles In their second matchup of the season the Washington Redskins hope to change that With Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz experiencing the exact opposite of a sophomore slump the highflying Eagles offense has shot to the top of the NFC with a 51 record A Monday night meeting with the Washington Redskins is just around the corner and Redskins defensive coordinator Greg Manusky knows how tough Philadelphias offense can be to stop especially on third down The Eagles rank first in thirddown conversion percentage with 506 percent Philadelphias 44 converted third downs also ranks first among NFL teams Manusky said a lot of that success has to do with the efficiency of Wentz The secondyear North Dakota State product has 1584 passing yards this season with 13 touchdowns compared to three interceptions I think overall from a passer rating he does a great job of scanning the field He does a great job of getting out of some pressure situations Manusky said He feels pressure and he knows exactly where its coming and he scoots through the lanes and he extends the play So we cant let him do that Wentz has plenty of targets to throw to most notably tight end Zack Ertz who ranked second in receiving yards among tight ends with 405 entering the weeks slate of games Receivers Alshon Jeffery and Nelson Agholor round out the top pass catchers in Philadelphia each with more than 300 yards on the season Manusky said stopping Ertz will be a top priority of Washingtons banged up defense We just have got to make sure that we have tight coverage on the guy make sure that we just keep on focusing on what we have to do within the scheme to take away certain individuals Manusky said However the passing game isnt the only factor elevating Philadelphias offense on third down The offseason addition of running back LeGarrette Blount gave the Eagles a way to take the pressure off Wentz and a viable option on 3rdandshort situations He does a great job of making people miss at the hole in the hole Manusky said of Blount So we have got to make sure we get in his face and be able to get him down He is a bigbody guy Going into Washingtons Week 5 bye many

Cousins would complete his first pass of the night to Terrelle Pryor Sr Then after being sacked Cousins would find Chris Thompson on a screen pass But on his next third down throw Cousins threw a pass

his legs as he also has three rushing touchdowns through six games At running back Ezekiel Elliott is expected to play despite a lingering off the field issue Elliott isnt quite on the same pace he was last year when he led the NFL in rushing as a rookie but the 2016 firstround pick rounded into form against the 49ers rushing for 147 yards while also catching a 72yard pass for a touchdown In each of the last two weeks the Ohio State product has rushed for at least 100 yards The receiving corps meanwhile like the Redskins is a group effort as six different players have at least 100 receiving yards to date The leader of the group though is Dez Bryant with 28 receptions for 327 yards and four touchdowns Longtime Dallas tight end Jason Witten also has 31 receptions for 283 yards and three touchdowns Defensively DeMarcus Lawrence is experiencing a breakout campaign as he already has 95 sacks half a sack off the NFL lead through seven weeks While Lawrence has had success getting to opposing quarterbacks Dallas has struggled creating turnovers as they have just two interceptions and five fumble recoveries Sundays meeting will be the 115 th meeting between to the two

Dunbars interception gave the Redskins an interception on an opponents opening drive for the second time this season Week 3 Montae Nicholson vs Oakland Special Teams Kicker Nick Rose made his NFL debut and converted his first career field goal attempt a 27yarder on the Redskins opening drive With Roses opening drive field goal the Redskins have now recorded points on their initial possession of five consecutive games for the first time in records dating back to 1999', 'Despite losing to the Eagles the Redskins saw the most production from tight end Jordan Reed than they have seen all season an indication that hes getting healthier Among the positives that the Redskins will take away from a game filled with its fair share of injuries and missed opportunities was the play of tight end Jordan Reed who emerged with his best game of the season in the Redskins 3424 loss to the Eagles Monday Night at Lincoln Financial Field Reed finished with eight receptions for 64 yards and two touchdowns all seasonhighs which indicated that he has started to regain his confidence and explosiveness after six games I think it was more of me getting more comfortable on the field Reed said Missed the whole offseason so just getting comfortable out there my toe is getting a little bit better and I got my burst back a little bit so all of that factors in Reed was rarely targeted in the first half Quarterback Kirk Cousins missed Reed on a pass to the end zone and then found him on the next drive during a thirdand1 on an outroute for no gain But in the second half Cousins targeted Reed more and was rewarded for it On consecutive plays on the offenses first drive of the third quarter Cousins found Reed for five and six yard completions On the next drive with the Redskins trailing by two touchdowns Reed caught a bullet from Cousins over the middle on third down to gain 20 yards On the next play Cousins went right back to Reed who spread out wide secured a tight slant pass in front of multiple Eagle defenders and pushed his way into the end zone Kirk gave me a chance and I was able to find the end zone Reed said On Washingtons second to last drive as hope began to evaporate for a chance to catch Philadelphias lead Cousins returned to the tight end during a hurryup offense finding Reed over the middle for a nineyard pass then a sixyard pass before culminating the drive with a 12yard slant into the end zone With the completion Reed passed Jean Fugett for thirdmost career receiving touchdowns 22 by a tight end in Redskins history trailing only Jerry Smith 60 and Chris Cooley 33 among tight ends in team history Mondays game also continued a nice trend for Reed against the Eagles who caught five passes against them in the season opener and caught nine passes for 129 yards and two touchdowns in Philadelphia two years ago to help Washington clinch the division title The multitouchdown game was Reeds first since Week 12 of the 2016 season at Dallas Jordan did well said tight end Vernon Davis who racked up four catches for 67 yards He finished strong he kept his mind in the game and he was able to do the things that hes able to do each week Were not worried about Jordan hes going to come out and perform when given the opportunity and he showed it tonight Reed said earlier in the week that he was physically speaking up to around 90 percent still recovering from a shoulder injury earlier in the year and the toe injury that put him on the PUP list for all of training camp Its taken time for him to adjust and look like his former self and so Monday night was an optimistic step forward for him Today felt better than the previous weeks Reed said Not a lot of pains out there and I was able to have confidence in my body It was good Just had confidence to stick my foot in the ground and press off and burst off of it so it felt good The Redskins will regroup on a condensed week in preparations for Dallas who they play this Sunday trying to get back on track against another division opponent More progress from Reed will certainly help their chances Weve just got to go out there and focus work hard and keep our confidence moving

       " 'Besides the fact that the Redskins starters will get a final extended opportunity on the field this Sunday this week has been helpful in getting players and coaches back to a game routine While the first couple of preseason games can occasionally offer a window into how the regular season will play out for a given team more often it extrapolates small amounts of data and churns them through a hype machine that creates a narrative mostly forgotten by the first week in September The third game however otherwise known as the final dress rehearsal for the firstteam offense and defense gives a sizeable chunk of playing time to the starters providing one last chance to find a rhythm before the opener For the Redskins this comes on a Sunday which means that the past several days have functioned like a regular game week In other words in opposition to the previous two games against the Ravens and Packers Redskins players have gameplanned for their upcoming opponent the Cincinnati Bengals like they would a regular season game getting back into the habit of a threeday practice schedule and watching film with their position groups For the first time this preseason theyll actually have an idea of what to expect when they jog onto the field This week is big running back Chris Thompson said We get to focus on our opponent a lot this week and not so much our offense going against our defense getting some really good looks out there We got to see a lot of Cincinnati last year so it helps to be able to go back and look at that film also because these first two games theyve had a lot of injuries and their starters havent put in a lot of time either Its just been big for us to go watch film and look at some things that they do well and just try to find out best way to execute This is a way of saying that all of the panic regarding the slow offensive starts and unproductive run game should be tempered The Redskins havent concerned themselves too much with preparing for opponents in which starters barely play and backups make the majority of highlights Defenses try out blitz schemes and offenses mostly react the best they can Were going to be fine wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr said earlier this week Everyone goes through a process where you dont really break down the defense You look at the Giants for example Did they look any more spectacular than us And their offense is going to be good I dont care what you say So theres little things that youve got to iron outRight now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday That optimism stems from the fact that the Redskins are hoping to have everyone on offense together on the field for the first time since offseason practices as tight end Jordan Reed returned from the PUP list earlier this week and Josh Doctson looked sharp in his limited action against Green Bay Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh said Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter Aside from getting in sync on the field for an extended amount of time the week of preparation from a filmwatching and installation standpoint remains important The majority of training camp is spent watching tape of teammates which only helps so much With a full week of studying an opposing team players start exercising their mental muscles again adjusting to the routines of the week Just like anything else you take off from practice or if youre away from the game for a little while you come back youre a little rusty have to get your feet under you and just like watching film tight end Vernon Davis said We watch film all the time in training camp we watch each other we watch the plays so it all comes together its not much of a difference its just that youre getting in that habit getting in that room where youre accustomed to doing those things The same goes for the coaching staff which has shuffled around a bit with the promotion of Cavanaugh who has learned how to delegate certain responsibilities to other coaches and given them a good idea of how the regular season will function day to day Its been helpful for the players too I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Cavanaugh said Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the real things going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff Its hard to appreciate the impact of establishing a routine over results but the Redskins are hoping the latter will come because of the former Theres still some time to fix things Cavanaugh said and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes',\n",
       " 'Entering his fourth year with the Redskins quarterback Colt McCoy has never been more comfortable and confident in his career As he prepares for another season McCoy reflects on his time in Texas going through adversity and taking pride in an unheralded role How cool was it to have both of your daughters watch you at training camp this year It was cool It was the first time my family had come to training camp have two little girls and that was a nice breakup to camp see them after practice let them run around for a little bit Kids are such a blessing Its fun to let them see their dad at work I spend so much time here kind of get a glimpse of what I do even though theyre not really old enough to understand yet its just fun to have them around So that was the first time they both saw you on the field Yeah I think so Whats it like having two daughters now Its awesome its work Kids are great but they require a lot of time My wifes a saint she does a great job with them The time that I do get to spend with them I cherish it And you had a full offseason to see your second daughter grow up Yeah I was there for all the dirty work Whens the last time you had to buy yourself a drink in Austin Texas Not very often People in Texas are great Its pretty neat to be able to go back there for a month or so during the offseason and see family and friends and Austins a great place It makes me feel pretty special the way people feel about me there Its pretty cool Do you still feel like a celebrity when youre there I guess a little bit I dont really look at it that way I try to be involved in the community there and here as much as I can My wife and I do a lot for childrens hospitals Im a pretty laidback guy I stay out of the scene as much as possible Playing in the NFL were already in a glass box so the offseason is a time where I can relax and just spend some good family time and stay out of the spotlight Id imagine its hard to do that down there right Yeah anywhere you go you get recognized Thats nice What made you commit to the University of Texas Well I grew up in Texas I always kind of felt that if I ever had the chance to go play at UT that I was going to do that Late in my high school career I got the offer and loved Coach Mack Brown and it was a dream come true for me I really didnt have any doubts thats where I was supposed to be Its such a different city than the rest of Texas Yeah the perception of Texas is a little different and then you go to Austin and youre like Whoa I didnt know this was really Texas Its a great place Its pretty hill country lots of water You can pretty much find whatever you want there You finished in the Top3 Heisman vote two times in your college career Did you ever have any bitterness about missing out Maybe I thought I may win it the first year 2008 that I got invited The second year I wasnt all that concerned because we were playing in the National Championship and that really was my ultimate goal anyways Looking back I got no regrets It was cool to be honored Football is a team sport man its a team sport in college its a team sport in the NFL Guys play well around you and you play well then generally youre going to have some success It wasnt anything I did I was part of a good team What was it like then jumping right to Cleveland You went from big man on campus to backup in a totally new environment Probably the biggest challenge of my life was that transition from college to pro I think the thing that is probably the most challenging for me was for the first time in my life I had not been healthy I had major shoulder issues From that hit in the championship game against Alabama Yeah issues to where didnt know if I was going to get drafted I went from thinking I was going to get drafted pretty high to not even knowing Thats a pretty big emotional ride there Then I go to Cleveland and there was no lack of effort or how bad I wanted to be successful there It just didnt work out for a lot of different reasons I just took it on the chin and tried to bounce back and now Im in a place where I feel confident I feel comfortable and I know where Im supposed to be Right now I feel like Ive grown up a lot since I first came into this league from that standpoint How do you mean I feel like Ive learned a lot about how this game is played Ive had the ability to sit back these last couple of years and watch and learn a whole lot of things and evaluate and figure out if Im given this opportunity again how am I going to handle it Im in a much better position now mentally and physically to handle that So yeah its been quite the journey but I feel Im where Im supposed to be right now What did you take away from your time in Cleveland that you still use today I took away a lot Ill never forget some of the things that happened in Cleveland whether you want to use that as motivation or you want to use that as a chance to learn and evaluate what went on I think in a lot of different ways Ive grown to channel some of the things that went on there and use it in a positive way and again Im happy with where I am now and I always prepare to do my best and answer the call if needed Is that from a football perspective or a personal growth one I think both I think from a football standpoint and also just a life standpoint Really before I came into the league I hadnt faced a whole lot of adversity had to bounce back and pick myself up from failure and things not going the way you want it to I think Ive just grown up a lot in general I dont think theres any situation that will come that I wont be able to handle When you faced that adversity did you have someone to lean on Yeah Ive got people around me that I feel like always shoot me straight From a football perspective I just had to really dial in on my job and my responsibilities Im not a better athlete than everyone else anymore Ive got to learn how to play the position and all the things that come with that I dont think theres any place Id rather be than right where I am now because I feel confident in what we do as a unit as an offense I feel like I can run that show I was in five systems my first five years in the league where I didnt know the intricacies of things that were going on Thats a tough thing playing quarterback Here Ive had three years now not a whole lot of experience on the field some but Ive really had a chance to speak the same language for this long and feel pretty confident about that And thats what you wrote about in The Players Tribune last year Is writing something that interests you after football That was fun to do that I kind of go about my business as professional as I can and try to be the same person every day but at the same time when The Players Tribune approached me about that I felt like it wouldnt be a bad idea to let people who always ask me to let them know Heres what Im doing heres where Im at Just because of being a backup Yeah and I think at this point in my career I hope for an opportunity at some point But at the same time Im thankful for where Im at learning how to lead when Im not on the field and being around guys every day and trying to help us win games Thats a challenge in itself for me but I do feel like I bring that to the table and I mean if anything Ive learned you just never know in this league whats going to happen and the best thing you can do is always be prepared Thats kind of my approach every day Because you never played a snap last year in the regular season did you get antsy I think you do get a little bit antsy As the weeks go by and as the season goes by you get halfway through the season its been three months since youve really played real football I think at that point its even more of a mental approach to coach yourself up keep grinding keep doing the extra stuff that youve done Maybe grab some receivers at the end of practice if theyre not gassed and work on some timing but thats all part of this game you know So how much do you cherish these next two games then I certainly dont take it for granted I think what the preseason allows me to do is realize this game is fun You play with guys you may or may not be playing with during the season But also look at it as a chance to help those guys to make a name for themselves help those guys make some plays And again as I mentioned earlier this is the ultimate team sport It takes 11 guys every time I want to be able to do my job as good as I can each play and hope that Im doing enough that the guys around me are doing their jobs and we can go score some points I look forward to preseason With that being said how much stock can you put into these games especially if you have a tough outing one day Its tough man Every time you want to go out on the field you want to put your best foot forward You want to play well I think theres a lot of things I did well against Baltimore theres a lot of things I need to clean up I think just as a unit overall we all gotta clean up We just gotta be a little more efficient and learn from some of those things When you think about Kirk Cousins ahead of you and the unpredictability of his upcoming offseason does it give you any consternation I think from being in the NFL for the last seven years if theres ever been a time where I have just been locked in on one day at a time its now because you just never know Kirk has played great the last couple of years I think hes going to have another great year The offense by the time we get to the season I think were going to have a pretty solid identity of who we are and what were trying to do I know theres high expectations in the locker room so even though Im not on the field Im part of that and Im proud of that I gotta do my part that if something does happen I need to come in and play a couple of games we dont miss a beat Thats what I take pride in Every day Im doing what Im supposed to do to be ready for that moment There may be other ways to look at it but for me thats the way Im going to approach it I heard you and Kirk both went to the Coldplay concert a couple weeks ago too Yeah it was cool Nate Sudfeld went too It was weird to do that during training camp but it was fun Who sang the most out of the three of you Oh Kirk and Nate for sure I didnt know many Coldplay songs I was listening to them on the way there so I could get familiar with them but Kirk and Nate knew all the songs So you just leaned on them Yeah I just leaned on them And are you giving Kirk any fathering advice with their baby due soon Yeah hes getting close Yeah hes asked me a little bit Im sure most of those questions are going to come when the babys here Theres always so many things with your first child youre just like I dont know what Im supposed to do Im sure those conversations will heat up a lot once the baby comes',\n",

health is the most important thing We all need the work coaches included on game day But we have to make sure theyre healthy also On if there is a possibility Galette andor Reed could play in the fourth preseason game No On if the value in playing Cincinnati is lessened given his familiarity with the team Its still the same You know Im familiar doesnt mean theyre familiar So we have to get them schooled up on what they do and some tendencies and try to attack them that way both offensively and defensively Trying to give them a picture of what to expect and see how they execute On if the receivers will have enough time to work with QB Kirk Cousins before Week 1 I hope so I think theres a lot of teams going through that with new receivers on new teams You know were going to utilize every second of the day we have outside and then inside the meeting rooms and Im sure theyll do some extra on their own time But I think being together as long as they have since OTAs and training camp got four preseason games in or three I think theyll be in good shape On if he scripts the first few plays of preseason games Yeah we give them a little first group of plays were going to expect to call early in the game so they get familiar with them And defense we will go over the calls and just get used to the calls and all that stuff at nightly meetings Offensive Coordinator Matt Cavanaugh On the difference in QB Kirk Cousins approach this year Even if he decides to grind a little less hes still grinding Hes got a nice schedule Hes got every minute accounted for Hes got a routine of how he studies an opponent everything starting from late Monday starting to look at tape looking at defensive scheme their personnel Tuesday getting a little more in depth whether hes doing it here or at home on his iPad and then obviously Wednesday we start installing a plan So hes still putting plenty of time in but I think he is a little more relaxed but hes never going to be satisfied and thats kind of what we want out of him Its a position that you cant ever think youve got it all figured out On how similar the preparation was this week to a regular season game Thats a great question We actually took this week as a mock regular season week so our preparation was pretty scheduled We simulated a typical Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday and then obviously tomorrow the last day before we play So it was kind of a dry run because of a couple of changes on the staff just for guys to get used to how we do it and that was a good reminder what the season is going to be like because it becomes a grind for us too I think we adapted really well We got a lot of work done we got the things installed on time that we needed to install And then a reminder that its the preseason is just you know its the third game of the preseason Obviously you want to win but you also just want to make sure youre getting guys good quality reps Wed like to be obviously more efficient and more productive offensively but were going out to try and score points and unfortunately the score really doesnt matter On if anything stuck out to him about being in a new position on staff From a routine standpoint no because Ive been here for two years and we didnt change the routine much It was just assigning some responsibilities that were someone elses and now a new guys doing it and me included So my time was a little more busy being accountable for the whole plan but I dont think there was major changes to what were doing and how were doing it On questions hed still like to have answered about the offense Listen we as an organization and certainly as an offense expect to be productive every time we go on the field and we werent The first game we had two threeandouts and that was pretty much it Last week it took us a little while to get started and then we had a nice twominute drive and looked better but we have high expectations We want to be more efficient running the ball We want to be more solid in protections We want to be accurate throwing balls and guys getting open So thats a focus of ours every day we go out You can always say Well good thing its the preseason because we havent been sharp for a couple of quarters until the second quarter of the last game we kind of picked it up a little bit But we need to go out and start fast That builds confidence that were going to do things the right way and were going to have it expected all the time Theres still some time to fix things and were excited about playing this weekend and well see where it goes On if this weeks preparation serves like a dress rehearsal for the regular season It does Its very much mirrored what our normal week is like Our meeting time was extended a little bit Qe were more detailed in the preparationWwe did segments so on Wednesday we put in our base first and seconddown plan with different personnel groups Thursday we did our third downs and then today we did our short yardage goal line and red zone and thats pretty much our routine for the week I think it gave the players a sense of the detail that has to be presented to them the kind of studying they have to do the notetaking they have to make and then they go home at night and this is were getting close Were getting close to the real thing so you might as well get used to what the routine is going to be like Were still going to give them time off were not going to beat them up but theres a routine that they have to get used to too as well as the staff On how deep into the playbook hes able to go in preparing players for preseason games Another great question Because its still the preseason particularly the first two games we really didnt narrow down a lot We kind of went in thinking everything weve practiced all through OTAs and training camp is still available to us Now that were game planning a team obviously that gets cut down so the number of plays wed carry in certain situations would be fewer with a lot more detail I think theyve felt like this week they had a chance to really zone in on what was going to be expected what plays to expect when to expect to them what their responsibilities were and that should help with execution On game plans being vanilla early in the preseason I dont know about know vanilla Quite honestly the first preseason game when you know your starters are only going to play half a dozen plays maybe 10 plays youre really more focused on the second and third groups and what can they handle Your starters come out they know the playbook so you kind of take some of that stuff away and then you get a little more vanilla if you will Last week we had a decent plan It wasnt a normal schedule but we put in a decent plan and it took us awhile to get rolling but we finally figured it out and then this week a lot more detail On Cousins growth with the uptempo offense He is probably a lot more prepared to do it now The more you are in an offense and the more you understand all the verbiage and nuances you run plays and you get different looks You might run the same play five times in a game and get a completely different look a different front a different pressure a different coverage and youre adjusting on the fly I think all that lends itself to him being more exposed to what might happen on a play So if we do something that is uptempo and the ball is snapped quickly his recognition should be a lot quicker and I think he is getting to that point We all as a group are going to put a game plan together we think will help us win the game whether its slowing the game down speeding it up throwing it every down running every down it really doesnt matter as long as we are all in agreement and we understand what our objectives are and what we have to do to win On the benefit of going uptempo Well the other thing it does is it makes the defense slow down a little bit too They have less time to react Youre going right to the line of scrimmage calling the play we are in a twominute mentality so we are going right to the line of scrimmage The quarterback is hand signaling he is calling out protections The defense has to get their call in they cant disguise coverages as well They dont want to get caught offguard Its hard from the sideline I think defensively to get a pressure on you know signaling pressure Some teams do it most dont So I think from that standpoint you kind of slow them down a little bit just by getting to the line of scrimmage real quick On the benefit of having the top four pass catchers on the field with Cousins on Sunday Well obviously they are all very talented guys so we want them out there We are also of the mindset that again this is not for real yet I mean we are playing a game and we want to play well and get a win but our opening game is almost two weeks away so we want to be ready for that We are not going to expose somebody in the preseason that we dont think is ready If they are ready to play and we get the OK from the medical people and the organization says lets play him well play him But I think most of those come down to gametime decisions They are all progressing well They have all been on the field for the most part the last few days and we are excited about that On C Chase Roullier Im not doing a lot of work with him but Bill Callahan is wearing him out Bill is putting in all the time necessary to get him prepared Now he has been here he is learning the offense He was getting a lot of work with the second group So he has just stepped up a notch He has been in with the ones I think his communication is getting much better He and Kirk are starting to feel each other out you know understanding Here is couple of my cadences that we have to master I want you to be real precise with your protection calls Remember I can always trump you and make a different call so listen what I am saying So those are things that he was getting to a real comfort level with Spencer Long and now he has got a younger guy in there who we have to feel him out too So from that standpoint it could happen at any position Any of the 11 positions somebody could go down and somebody else has to go in and we expect guys to come in and perform I am confident that Chase will do a fine job',\n",

Victory is presented by Papa Johns Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win STAY IN RHYTHM The Redskins firstteam offensive unit got off to a slow start against both the Baltimore and Green Bay before finally scoring a touchdown on a long drive against the Packers last Saturday Getting the ball just before the twominute warning quarterback Kirk Cousins marched the offense 78 yards down the field on 10 plays capped by a fouryard touchdown reception from wide receiver Jamison Crowder on a 4 th andgoal play just before halftime I do think we got in a rhythm in that twominute which helps Cousins said Plays were working and sometimes that can feed the next play Weve been pretty good when we get in a nohuddle and just have an up tempo to our offense thats been good for us We didnt get behind the chains We were I think for the most part in secondandmedium or thirdandmedium We didnt put ourselves in a lot of tough situations of thirdand12 or thirdand15 I think it was good to have that drive but weve all acknowledged that so far this preseason we havent been good enough for what we want to do this regular season Were excited for the chance on Sunday to start trying to put our best foot forward and put a better product on the field Cousins and Co played the entire first half against the Packers and it could be the same case this Sunday against the Bengals as is normally the case for the third preseason game One way in which Washington could get into a better flow is through the hands of wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr In the first two preseason games Pryor has caught one pass for 11 yards on three targets This week the pair stayed out at practice 30 minutes after it was completed to work on their timing As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time TIME TO STEP UP ROOKIE With Spencer Long currently sidelined after undergoing a minor procedure on his knee this week the Redskins will ask rookie sixthround pick Chase Roullier to take over the reins at center It is certainly a step up for Roullier as hes transitioned from a lateround pick at a small school to starting in the NFL in the matter of a few months But hes ready for the challenge It worked pretty well Roullier said of his work with the firstteam offensive unit Just continuing to learn the offense the best I can so that I am able to be more comfortable with my calls that Im making out there Its definitely something I need to continue to work on Ive had some errors in the last couple of games and its something Ive been focusing on practice Roullier also benefits from having a veteran offensive line around him along with Pro Bowl quarterback Kirk Cousins who said Roullier is very intelligent Hell be tasked with guiding an offensive line against one of the leagues more aggressive defenses He can pass protect I think thats a strength of his his ability to hold up in pass protection Cousins said Theres going to be growing pains Thats understandable but its exciting to see potential when its there and its certainly there with Chase Hes a good teammate a class act so Im excited to work with him Were going to throw him in the fire against the Bengals and see what he can do Im going to do all I can do to help him making protection calls and trying to be decisive so he doesnt have to think too much But Im excited to get him out there and see what hes got SEE WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE RETURNING PLAYERS The Redskins could be at near fullstrength on Sunday as tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Junior Galette returned to practice this week while wide receiver Josh Doctson increased his activity For Galette it could mark his first game in a Redskins uniform since first signing with the Redskins in 2015 The 2015 and 2016 campaigns resulted in seasonlong Injured Reserve stints due to torn Achilles while he was sidelined against the Ravens and Packers with a hamstring injury Gruden said on Thursday that hell be a gametime decision against the Bengals Its been two years so now its getting to the point where its like a movie thats supposed to be released and keeps getting postponed Galette said with a smile And youre like Man Then weve got Jay Gruden here talking about Youre just a tease You know hes kidding around but at the same time youre like I want to go out there and prove that I am everything they expect me to be As for Reed he was activated off the ActivePhysically Unable to Perform list after spending all of training camp on the sideline with a toe injury He was a full participant in practices this week His presence on the field alone significantly alters the landscape of the offense particularly one that is looking to end the preseason on a high note Jordan has unique movement skills and then because hes often lined up in a way where hes being covered by safeties and linebackers and nickel corners he creates matchup issues said Cousins If you want to put your best corner on Jordan Reed thats one option but then now youre opening a door for whoever else is out there a Josh Doctson a Terrelle Pryor a Vernon Davis so on and so forth SHOW EM WHAT YOU CAN DO MASE For the second week in a row the Redskins will have Mason Foster guiding the defensive unit as the Mike linebacker with Zach Brown serving as the Moe linebacker Last week the pair started together and totaled a combined five tackles I think he is just a physical cat in there said Redskins defensive coordinator Greg Manusky From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit Manusky added that perhaps the biggest asset of having Foster and Brown together is their ability to cover the entire field Thats why I like both of them right now Manusky said Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the

       " 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On encouraging TE Jordan Reed in a oneonone drill against S DJ Swearinger Its a very competitive period down there oneonones receivers vs Dbacks And its a great route You know the whole thing about it is defensive backs have got to make it a perfect throw and a great catch Fortunately it was a great throw and a great catch for Jordan and Kirk DJ was right there had great coverage But yeah its great to have him back On the health of Reed and LB Junior Galette Jordan looks fine He looks good You know I still want to see how hes doing tomorrow and then obviously Saturday and Sunday see how he does in pregame warmup but he looks very good Very crisp very fast very sudden like he always is which is good Junior hes been doing more and more each day and I think thatll be a gametime decision On LB Ryan Anderson Same thing Same thing He did a little less today but were going to keep getting him checked out and were not going to push the issue unless he has full strength full range of motion and full strength Right now he doesnt have full strength Hes close though very close On if C Chase Roullier is preparing to start at center in Week 1 Were preparing Chase like he needs to go You know I think getting Spencer Long back were hopeful even if it could be in a backup role if hes not 100 percent ready So theres a good chance there also So we have a couple different options But the big thing is to get Chase ready to go and take advantage of the reps hes getting And hes done that hes done a nice job We just brought another center in here for depth you know we need for Sundays game and for the game against Tampa Well take a good look at Lucas Crowley and see how he does On the inside linebackers and the status of that position group Where do we stand Right now were starting with Mason Foster and Zach Brown You know thats a starting point And then obviously Martrell Spaight and Will Compton will get plenty of reps and then youve got Nico Marley and Zach Vigil and then obviously Josh HarveyClemons So we have a good stable there We kind of moved Pete Robertson to outside backer when all our outside backers got injured So hes getting some reps as a pass rusher and hes doing a good job On what he likes about Mason Foster at Mike linebacker I think you know Mason played well last year He really did And hes a smart player and hes very physical So we like his physicality Hes healthy and hes playing well On the nickel corners I think right now Kendall Fuller is probably our nickel corner if we had to start today Joshua Holseys doing an excellent job though you know For a rookie a seventhround pick hes surpassed expectations by far Hes done a good job both outside and inside So those two guys are really the ones were counting on On his level of concern potentially starting a rookie at center Yeah seems like weve had a little rollercoaster ride at center since Ive been here Kory Lichtensteiger was here and then he got hurt We had to try Josh LeRibeus and last year we had some issues early on so I think we just have to get Chase Roullier ready We drafted him for a reason Hes a true center from Wyoming and did a good job last year at Wyoming but he is a rookie But hes a very smart guy and hes learned a lot Coach Bill Callahan has done an excellent job with him If he has to play I think hell be ready He has a couple major obstacles at Philadelphia Fletcher Cox and Tim Jernigan there inside and they have some good pass rushers so itll be a great test for him You dont ever like to thrust a guy into the fire but we think hes a mature guy and if he has to play hell play If Spencer Long is ready to go itll be great but Chase is mature and I think he can handle it On the rotation at center during the past few seasons Its difficult because the centers the one who makes all the calls presnap Hes the one that communicates and youve got to have a smart center You want an athletic center you want a big center At the end of the day youve got to have a center that number one theyve got to get the snaps back and theyve got to be able to communicate Then theyve got to be able to finish blocks and be able to get up on the next level and pass protect and all that good stuff Theres a lot on a centers plate especially for a rookie But like I said Chase can handle it Weve had to mix and match different centers since Ive been here but we just have to deal with it On if he has adjusted the reps for firstteam offense in practice Oh yeah were trying to get as many reps as we can without wearing them down Yesterday we had about a 17play drive to end practice which was good to get them out there and stay on the field and were trying to get more and more together Very important like you say once you get everybody back Still its important for Kirk Cousins to get as many looks as he can get so well try to do the best we can without wearing them out but get them a lot of reps On how important QB Kirk Cousins ability to help Roullier at center is A lot a lot I think earlier in Kirks career it might have been a little bit more of an issue but I think now this stage Kirk feels a lot more comfortable with the protection calls and hell help out a lot The big thing is initially getting the calls right and I think Chase has done a good job so far out here Its going to be a great test for the Bengals Defensive Coordinator Paul Guenther and the Bengals they give you a lot of different looks double As they give you the odd looks they give you spinner looks threedown fronts fourdown fronts all of them So it will be a great test for us Defensive Coordinator Greg Manusky On the combination of Mason Foster and Zach Brown at inside linebacker I mean were going back and forth all the time during practice with Mason and with Comp Will Compton and then with Zach and even Martrell Spaight We are going through a process thats the preseason right now Thats why I like both of them right now Mason and Zach inside they are doing a good job from a coverage perspective The communication has been well across the board and just making the calls So right now just getting in that smooth progression with some players just figuring them out and who is going to be our starter at the end of the preseason On what Foster brings to the Mike linebacker position I think he is just a physical cat in there From a mental standpoint he is starting to adjust to it Over the course of training camp and then OTAs trying to learn it a little bit more in depth but overall he has been doing a great job with communication a great job stuffing the runs and hitting the holes that we are supposed to hit On if he can make sense of Defensive Line Coach Jim Tomsulas rotation along the defensive line No Ive known Jimmy for a long time and I just let him do whatever he wants to do pretty much From our aspect we want to see players play at different positions because during the season you never know you might need a backup nose that has played end and vice versa So switching those guys inside and out has been a good scenario because they have got to learn left defensive end they have got to learn right defensive end they have got to learn a little bit of nose as well We are just tinkering with it figuring out what is going to happen Here in the next couple weeks we will figure it out On when he changes from evaluating the whole roster to focusing on preparing the starters I think in this third preseason game I think thats kind of the avenue that we are sticking with but across the board you never know Some guys get injured or sometimes other guys do show up from a previous game they didnt play as good You know every game is different for every player because sometimes they have had great performances and other times they just didnt just for some reason We are honing in on it of course with the players that we have got going into this third preseason game Rotationally wise Jimmy up front I dont know maybe the second series is totally different We do have a plan in place and we kind of know where we are going to try and alter it On the value of having a nose tackle that can play in the nickel package as well I think that is a big plus That is what we are trying find out I am just saying that sometimes during the preseason games at the end of the game we want to see them against a little bit better competition too So switching those guys is a point that we are trying to figure out On his philosophy on where CB Josh Norman will lineup in his defensive system I think certain corners are sometimes really relaxed on the right side and some are on the left and sometimes if you flip them at times it actually messes with their head It depends on the individual If he feels comfortable switching sides then that is fine All of a sudden if he feels like we have a threat on the outside that we have to have Josh cover then we will flip them It depends on the personnel and it also depends on the player that you have On what makes CB Kendall Fuller a good fit at nickel corner He is smart I think from a smart player inside that has good quickness and capabilities of reading the route combinations And that guy sometimes if you move that corner into that nickel spot it is a lot of space its a lot of room and sometimes they dont have a great feel for it Kendall has been doing a great job We will be cross training of course Joshua Holsey has been doing it and we will be training some other corners inside as well On how Normans skill set fits into the defensive system It is the things that you cant coach I think from that standpoint he is just a savvy player that has a feel for the game I think even when you draft players coming out of college there is just certain guys that just have a feel for the game Its just uncanny Even Jonathan Allen has a feel for the game and you cant say anything but that these guys have a feel for the game That is what Josh has From defensive calls stick him in a one always covering that same guy over and over and over I am going to try to use his talents a little bit better try to get him in quarters a little bit and get him in different coverages that we have So we will get him to play the ball a little bit more On how important it is to see LB Junior Galette in game action before the regular season I think it is huge We have got to see him that way because he hasnt started he hasnt played in two years or whatever it has been During practice he has been doing a great job He is confident in his abilities His abilities are very good right now I think right now learning the defense he has done a great job but he has been banged up I want to see him against good personnel and see what he can do So it is majorly important that he plays in these preseason games On how his relationship with players has changed since transitioning from a position coach to a coordinator I dont think it has been any different They knew who I was and I talked to all the defensive players when I was here last year as an outside linebacker coach I think the biggest thing is the acquisition of the coaches that we have brought in With Jimmy and Torrian Gray and James Rowe and then with Chad Grimm and then Kirk Olivadotti all those guys its a tight group of coaches that are very specific I always tell the coaches this when I was a position coach I just facilitate the information from the guy that wants it to the players I cant sit in the room with 30 some guys and say OK this is what the corner is doing It is going to waste too much time They do a great job of facilitating the information that I am trying to get to those players and we are having success with it On how quickly S DJ Swearinger was able to integrate himself into the team I think it was the first week Just like the physical gifts and talents that players have some guys just have that aura about them and that is what he has He has that power I love the energy that he brings to the table and across the board he is trying to get it right I dont know exactly how many years he has been in the league but he has been doing a couple jumps back a forth from different teams He wants to see what he can do and see this defense where it is going to go and it is going to a high place I think On his perception of Normans play last year and if it has changed You know last year he played fine Sometimes it is just situational stuff Splits the receivers which Torrian Gray does a great job of talking about with the players across the board just honing their skills into the level of just breaking it down from a football knowledge I think that is what Torrian is doing with him and actually DJ helping him as well Everybody is helping each other on the back end From a calls perspective theyre doing a great job and we are playing together I dont care what call it is as long as we are all on the same page we will have success',\n",

       " 'Back on the practice field this week following a hamstring injury that sidelined him during the second half of training camp Junior Galette could play in Sundays game against Cincinnati For more than two years now the Washington Redskins have waited to unleash pass rusher Junior Galette on the field A July 2015 free agent signing for the Redskins Galette registered 22 combined sacks across the 201314 seasons which ranked tied with Ryan Kerrigan for secondmost in the NFC and tied for sixthmost in the NFL in that span But since the end of the 2014 season Galette has yet to see the field in any preseason or regular season action Both his 2015 and 2016 campaigns were wiped clean by separate torn Achilles and he hasnt appeared in the first two preseason games this year as hes dealt with a hamstring injury Galette returned to the practice field on Wednesday though participating in individual drills alongside his fellow outside linebackers The team also tested him out on some of the 11ondrills which head coach Jay Gruden said Galette felt pretty good with after the completion of the session Its been two years so now its getting to the point where its like a movie thats supposed to be released and keeps getting postponed Galette said with a smile And youre like Man Then weve got Jay Gruden here talking about Youre just a tease You know hes kidding around but at the same time youre like I want to go out there and prove that I am everything they expect me to be The Stillman College product could potentially make his Redskins debut Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals although Gruden doesnt want to rush him back The head coach said hell be a gametime decision on Sunday afternoon I would like to get him some action before he plays because he hasnt played in a couple years Gruden said So I would like to get him out there but I also dont want to jeopardize his hamstring and have him reinjure it There is a fine line there We will have to wait and see how he does Getting Galette back on the field whether thats this Sunday against the Bengals or waiting until the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept 10 will provide the Redskins a boost to an outside linebackers corps that took a hit when Trent Murphy was lost for the year with a torn ACL and MCL suffered in the preseason opener against the Baltimore Ravens Gruden understands that Galette is fired up to return to game action Hes put a lot of work in Gruden said earlier this month Im proud of the fact of what hes accomplished getting his body right getting his weight down getting himself in football shape He feels like hes in as good of shape as hes ever been in Now its about working on his pad level his hand placement and all that stuff Hes on the right track Defensive coordinator Greg Manusky added that getting Galette preseason reps would be huge We have got to see him that way because he hasnt started he hasnt played in two years or whatever it has been Manusky said During practice he has been doing a great job He is confident in his abilities His abilities are very good right now I think right now learning the defense he has done a great job but he has been banged up I want to see him against good personnel and see what he can do So it is majorly important that he plays in these preseason games Before suffering a hamstring injury in training camp Galette was one of the standout players when the team was at the Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center in Richmond Va The speed rusher was giving fivetime Pro Bowler Trent Williams a run for his money at times during 1on1 drills which rarely happens Its the best way to get better Galette said of his camp battles with Williams Hes going into Year Eight and I played six years I cant think of an NFL lineman thats better than him so you have to take advantage Every chance I get to go up against him I tell him Im not going to take this play off because you dont get to see a lineman like that every Sunday His eventual return to the field 32 months after he last appeared in a game setting will be something special to watch Im going to give him a little credit too from this standpoint how many guys can have two Achilles on different ankles and work as hard as he has to get back to this point I think he did that said Redskins vice president of player personnel Doug Williams said I mean he cant control a little tweak of the hamstring I do believe if we can get him on the field well see some of the Junior Galette that we are looking for Im going to give him the benefit of the doubt and say I think we can get something out of him',\n",
       " 'The quarterback and wide receiver duo has been working together throughout the offseason but after two preseason games they still need to enhance their rapport The pursuit to get better has been the driving force behind the last year for Terrelle Pryor Sr switching positions to wide receiver and looking to take the next step in his career on a new team with a quarterback hes still adjusting to Thats been made clear throughout most of this offseason and training camp as both have made continual efforts to improve their games by learning from each others perspective and taking time for more reps after practice Wednesday offered another good example During drills Pryor caught a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins and while the connection looked clean something felt a little off for the wide receiver As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time The postpractice activity lasted for about 30 minutes and its the kind of work that Pryor believes should be endemic to the way professionals train If you know that something isnt right and then you dont fix it you really arent pros and you really dont take this job seriously That mindset is what has propelled Pryor this offseason evidenced in his countless workout videos he posted over the summer and its also what fuels Cousins who has needed to adjust to a new batch of receivers Particularly the workouts have been about timing accounting for different types of coverages and adjusting accordingly For example Pryor said he knows that when cornerbacks will throw press and bump coverage Cousins will take a hitch in his dropback knowing it will take Pryor a little longer to find separation from his defender This kind of work makes sense especially considering that Pryors only caught one pass on three targets in two preseason games Their preparation for those games was limited in terms of studying their opponents and Pryor was surprised by some of the coverages the Ravens threw at them in just a couple of series When we came out against the Ravensthey had safeties rolling over top doubleteaming me they had the safety double teaming me and nobody on top of the other guy Pryor said I didnt expect that in the preseason so little things like that happen that you werent expecting This is the rationale for not panicking about the firstteam offenses sluggish starts Pryor pointed to the Giants whose own offense has struggled even as it is expected to do big things this season too Pryor thinks there should be some bigger improvements against the Bengals this Sunday When you start gameplanning this is where were going were going to TP on this play were going to Jamison Crowder were going to Jordan Reed on this play this is the matchup were looking forward Pryor said We get in the game its there now its up to us to win it catch the ball and make the play Right now were running plays and we just want to get better We just want our rhythm a little better but were game planning a little right now so we should come out fire on Sunday Cousins has appreciated Pryors approach and its rubbed off on his own work ethic I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year In other words theres nothing special happening here except in the desire to keep grinding and getting better than before to hit the ground running in sync and ready for the Eagles You just want to go back over it and make sure weve got it down Pryor said So when we get into the Week 1 and get into game time serious time its all clicking we can just go',\n",

       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 The Redskins get the ground game back on track through some powerful running from Fat Rob In Washingtons first two preseason outings the combination of Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson struggled to generate a balanced offensive attack Against the Baltimore Ravens and Green Bay Packers the pair combined for just 21 rushing yards Those woes continued through the first quarter of Sundays nationally televised matchup with the Bengals as Kelley ran the ball just one time for four yards as the Redskins did not pick up a first down on the opening frame But in the second quarter Kelley finally got it going first with a fiveyard run and then a 21yard gain in which the Tulane product sliced the middle of an overly aggressive Cincinnati defense Kelley capped the drive with a oneyard touchdown run on 2 nd andgoal his first score of the preseason I think the difference for me was the offensive line Kelley admitted after the game They opened up some holes Obviously you can see they had some holes that anybody could run through out there I think just getting back to what got me to starting running back today Just some hard runs pushing the pile and stuff like that So we have to get back to the basics Kelley would finish the afternoon with 10 carries for 57 yards while Thompson chipped in with nine yards as well I think we were able to do a couple different things Gruden said We tried some gap pulls and some gap runs We did some outside zone some inside zones and for the most part I guess we executed well 2 For the first time as a member of the Redskins Junior Galette saw game action Galette joked in the days leading up to Sundays game with the Bengals that his return to the field was like a highly anticipated movie that kept getting delayed Originally signed by the Redskins during 2015 training camp Galette twice suffered torn Achilles that wiped away his last two years Then after an impressive early training camp showing this year Galette was held out of Washingtons first two preseason games with a hamstring injury But on Sunday Galette appeared on 21 defensive snaps and recorded two tackles It felt amazing man Galette said Coming in here going through the process getting on the bus from the hotel the pregame meal everything felt amazing like I never left Its been two years Just enjoying the camaraderie everything the pregame music on my headphones going out there warming up it felt great Galettes best trait as a football player is his speed rush On his very first play he nearly recorded a sack when the Stillman College product got a perfect jump off the line and ducked inside of the Bengals left tackle to apply pressure to Andy Dalton Dalton got the ball off on a quick threestep drop but Galette was just inches away from taking down the quarterback Ive been doing everything I did in the game in practice so it just felt great you know to just go do it in live action Galette said 3 Kirk Cousins was disappointed in his picksix but remains optimistic about whats ahead for the passing attack during the regular season In his final preseason action before the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Cousins completed 10of19 passes for 109 yards along with an eightyard carry on a third down quarterback keeper As was the case in his first two preseason showings Cousins struggled to get the offense moving in the first quarter In the first 15 minutes the Pro Bowler completed just 2of5 attempts for 11 yards while taking two third down sacks and being called for intentional grounding on another third down play Opening up the second quarter Washingtons offense appeared poised to final break through as the Redskins broke into Cincinnati territory in just four plays But on a 3 rd and5 attempt in which Cousins tried to locate Thompson coming out of the backfield Bengals linebacker Vontaze Burfict jumped the running backs route and sprinted down the sidelined for a 62yard interception return for touchdown The interception was entirely my fault Cousins said He made a very good play but I gave him the opportunity to do that by being a little late to get there And then it was a good response to put that drive together We ran the ball so well with some really good play calls All those plays run together for me right now so you probably know better than me how we got down there But it was important to bounce back certainly Washington responded well though to the interceptions as Cousins led a 10play 75yard touchdown drive in which he completed three different passes of at least 12 yards locating Vernon Davis Terrelle Pryor Sr and Jamison Crowder for the gains With tight end Jordan Reed back on the field Washingtons offense particularly the passing game is at nearstrength entering the regular season We do have high expectations for a lot of different reasons Cousins said of the passing game For one we do protect well we have a very solid offensive line thats where it starts You have to have time to throw We do feel we have several players not just at the receiver position but the tight end position and the running back position who can help us in the pass game and its never going to be the same guy week in and week out its probably going to evolve each weekwho gets involved and who makes the biggest difference But we have high expectations and you have to be ready to go 4 Jordan Reed returns from the PUP List to record two catches for 12 yards After spending the entirety of training camp rehabbing a toe injury Washingtons Pro Bowl tight end was activated off the Physically Unable to Perform list on Aug 20 He was a full participant in last weeks practices and showed little rust in his return to the field catching two passes for 12 yards both on first down attempts on 18 plays Its great Crowder said of Reeds return I think that now that everyone is back for the offense that we are able to go forward and practice get that camaraderie back within the unit and hopefully be ready and productive We have Philadelphia coming Reeds presence changed the way Cincinnati approached Washingtons offense as the tight end was doubled on more than one occasion I did feel the defense was aware of him Cousins said He is a presence has a big effect on every game plan so we have to continue getting him out there and working together and get ready for Week 1 5 With a chip on their shoulder the secondteam defensive unit slowed Cincinnatis backups After the starters played all of the first half inside linebacker Martrell Spaight and the second defensive unit took over in the third quarter In the second half Cincinnati managed just three points Their final five drives ended with two punts two turnover on downs and an interception I felt like we did a great job said Spaight who finished with a gamehigh seven tackles We got a few stops out there the turnovers the sudden change we did a good job and Im thankful for that Late in the game Cincinnati appeared ready to potentially take back the lead as they drove all the way down to Washingtons 12yard line with less than nine minutes remaining But a 3 rd and5 attempt by McCarron the quarterback misplaced a ball that would find the hands of rookie safety Fish Smithson who returned the ball 63 yards into Washington territory I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they was going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play',\n",

       " 'The Redskins got some big plays from rookies Joshua Holsey and Fish Smithson in the second half of their preseason victory over the Bengals Sunday night Most of the focus during the Redskins third preseason game Sunday evening at FedExField centered on the starters This was the dress rehearsal game after all the last time the firstteam offense would get a chance to play together before the regular season opener in a couple of weeks But there was still a game to be played in the second half where some young defensive backs stepped in to make some big plays including a defensive stand in the red zone with the clock winding down that helped the Redskins defeat the Bengals 2317 to collect the teams first victory of the preseason A tally in the preseason win column may not seem like a huge deal in the broad scheme of things except that every player battling for a roster spot knows their performance will be under constant scrutiny Making plays is at once important for the team and as an individual achievement to take pride in Or as undrafted safety Fish Smithson reasoned Some people dont watch the preseason they say it dont matter but at the end of the day inside out it matters after the way we won and the players that were out there wanted to make a stand We didnt want to give in we make plays and let people know we belong on the field Smithson had one of the highlights of the day a fourthquarter interception off quarterback AJ McCarron in front of the end zone that he nearly returned for a touchdown tripping up after 63 yards After a mostly quiet first two games this was the moment Smithson knew he was capable of taking I kind of just read the quarterback and just made the play out there based off instincts Smithson said The coaches did a really good job of preparing us and letting us know what they were going to do some of their tendencies throughout the week I just went out there and did what I was coached to do and made a play I thought he was going to go all the way to house with it cornerback Joshua Holsey said But thats good for us these young guys especially for him because hes had a really good training camp preseason as well Holsey made his big plays too His moment came in the third quarter after he had already made a good play in coverage to force an incompletion on third down Sent on a nickel blitz he is the teams other nickel corner behind Kendall Fuller Holsey saw the left tackle occupy an outside linebacker and had a clear path once running Jarveon Williams stepped up to block another blitzer in inside linebacker Will Compton Holsey used his speed to run down McCarron and got the first sack of his NFL career Once I seen the tackle go high and the back disappear I just hit another gear Holsey said Had to make sure I secured the sack it was all fun from there Holsey who played 25 snaps Sunday knew hed get a decent amount of opportunities once Fuller sat out One of the nice surprises at camp the seventhround pick knows that the cornerback room is pretty full but Sundays game was another positive impression for coaches You get that gametime experience good close games youve got to be able to make plays Holsey said These games right here give the coaches a good key of who they can trust in big situations they gotta be able to trust you out there on that field When I go out there I just try to make sure I do my assignment and fly around to the ball Thats what they want to see they just gotta make plays Right not its just me trying to just show them what I can do because its a great DB room right now Just trying to help my role with that group of guys He remained on the field during the final red zone stand where veteran safety Will Blackmon made a couple of big plays in the backfield before defensive back Jeremiah McKinnon broke up a pass in the back of the end zone on fourth down You dont want to be the guy that gives up that play Holsey said We were all talking the whole drive like we gotta make a play we gotta make a play lets get this started lets get off the field so its just a big momentum rush for us to get out there and make a play get a stop for the team and get us that first W of the preseason Between Holsey and Smithson their biggest test will come this Thursday in the teams final preseason game at Tampa Bay After Sundays performances they will carry some confidence into the short week hoping to channel that momentum into another big night Its big Sometimes you can go through games and not be able to make plays because at the end of the day the only thing you got is the film Smithson said So its kind of good to show people what you can do At the end of the day I made a good play but now Im moving on to Tampa And as for those Fish puns saturating social media Smithson is happy to see them Oh man I can just imagine he said My phones been blowing up I havent looked at it yet but Im ready for it',\n",

       " 'The veteran defensive lineman was one of the top stories for the Redskins over the last month but is now sidelined for the season by a torn quad tendon suffered in the first quarter of Sundays game vs Cincinnati After suffering a torn left quad tendon during Sundays preseason Week 3 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals at FedExField in Landover Md Washington Redskins defensive lineman Phil Taylor Sr is out for the 2017 season Redskins head coach Jay Gruden confirmed the news during his Tuesday afternoon press conference Taylor will have surgery on Wednesday I feel terrible for Phil because he did a great job at getting himself ready to play Gruden said Hes in excellent shape but its just an unfortunate injury The rest of the guys have got to step up Taylor was turning into one of the best stories in the NFL prior to his torn quad The former firstround pick of the Cleveland Browns hadnt played in a regular season game since 2014 but was named the teams starting nose tackle on the first unofficial depth chart of the year Prior to suffering multiple injuries during his final two seasons with the Browns Taylor was among the most productive linemen in the league during his rookie season as he recorded 59 tackles with four sacks two passes defensed and a fumble forced The Baylor product was named to the PFWA AllRookie Team for his efforts While Taylor struggled to replicate his debut season due to the injuries he looked sharp while the team was at the Bon Secours Washington Redskins Training Center in Richmond Va I was in Cincinnati for three years when he was at Cleveland and I know what a force he can be at nose said Gruden the former offensive coordinator of the Bengals earlier this month He was tough to deal with he really was We had him for a workout and I didnt even know he was on the streets His knee looked better He was in good shape He had a whole offseason and did some good things In total Taylor appeared on 23 defensive snaps during the preseason and recorded two tackles along with a sack With Taylor now sidelined the Redskins will look to Joey Mbu AJ Francis Stacy McGee and Ziggy Hood among others to fill the void at nose tackle Those guys have played well Gruden said Its been a constant battle throughout OTAs and training camp so those guys have gotten a lot of work Coach Jim Tomsulas rotated them in there different people with different groups part of the plan',\n",
       " 'Head Coach Jay Gruden On injuries The only injury that Ill go over is Phil Taylor Hes going to have surgery tomorrow He tore his left quad tendon He will be out for the year On the depth at nose tackle with DL AJ Francis and Joey Mbu Yeah Ziggy Hood can play there Stacy McGee can play there some too Those guys have played well Its been a constant battle throughout OTAs and training camp so those guys have gotten a lot of work Coach Jim Tomsulas rotated them in there different people with different groups part of the plan I feel terrible for Phil Taylor Sr because he did a great job at getting himself ready to play Hes in excellent shape but its just an unfortunate injury The rest of the guys have got to step up On his impressions of the firstteam offense from last Sunday Theres obviously a lot of coaching that we have to do clean up some things but overall I like the way we bounced back and stayed in the game Quite frankly thats the way a lot of our games are going to be in 2017 Theyre going to be close theres going to be some adversity and were going to have to overcome it and make some plays to keep us in games and then win them late There were some good things that we liked and obviously a lot of things that we need to clean up as is the case every week in pro football On what he hopes to see from the second and thirdstring players on Thursday Im hoping they play well Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust On if he would be more comfortable shifting DL Ziggy Hood and Stacy McGee to nose tackle as compared to more traditional nose tackles like Mbu and Francis Well see well see A lot is going to determine that how many defensive linemen are we going to dress on game day thats one if we dress five or six on game day how many were going to keep on the 53man roster Theres still some time for us to have those discussions and we will On if he feels more confident potentially starting Chase Roullier at center in Week 1 Yeah if I had to start him Id better feel OK because hes starting but he did some good things He mistargeted a couple plays which is natural a lot of movement Cincinnati had on certain down and distances But for the most part he did well He competed well and he stood his ground I felt him getting up to the next level a few times and he blocked some good defensive lineman over there so I was impressed with his first outing Weve just got to clean up some of his communication but overall I think he did well On if QB Nate Sudfeld will play the entire game Thursday Thats the intent yes On if Thursday is a chance for Sudfeld to prove he is worthy of a roster spot The thing about Nate is that Colt McCoy and Kirk Cousins are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back On his level of concern with WR Josh Doctson s injuries Well its been an issue Weve only had him a year a little bit over a year now and he hasnt really done a lot with us unfortunately but I think hes going to overcome these I think he could have played last week he could play Thursday if we wanted him to I think hes going to be ready to go for Philadelphia and now its a matter of keeping him out there and knock on wood we hope we can do that On if he views Doctson as a starting receiver Well we have some players there that have been performing in practice in his absence that have done well obviously Jamison Crowder and depends how many receivers you play If you play a tworeceiver set right now Crowder could be the starting Z it could be Josh it could be Ryan Grant We have plenty of options there The big thing is we want to keep them fresh If Terrelle Pryor Sr gets tired I wont hesitate at putting Josh at X or Ryan Grant at X or whatever so we have a good group of wideouts that could play anywhere at any time On if Doctson is having any trouble with confidence in his own health I dont know youd have to ask him that I think he just had some unfortunate he was running a lot in OTAs and training camp and he was doing some really good things It wasnt like he pulled it it was just tight I guess so to speak It hasnt been a major pull so I think hes going to be okay On if there is concern about LB Ryan Anderson being ready for the start of the season Well see I think if youve missed this much time theres some concern because he needs the practice Its not like we can just throw him out there Hey Hes a rookie he needs a lot of work the communication where hes supposed to be and how to get there So there is a little level of concern there but we feel like hell be ready eventually we just dont know when Its a unique injury Weve just got to get his strength back On if Roullier will play on Thursday Thats a good question You know we will wait and see come Thursday afternoon We will go through pregame warmup and see where we stand We will try to get Chase maybe a series or two and see how it goes but Ronald Patrick will get the majority We will go from there On if there is temptation to play players who might have starting roles who havent had a lot of reps Junior Galette is definitely not going to play He played with his injury very similar to Josh Doctson but he is not going to play Thursday Josh wants to play Thursday but that will be my decision here in about 24 hours On LB Will Compton RB Rob Kelley and CB Kendall Fuller Will Compton no he just has a chest contusion a little bit Kelley and Fuller Theyre OK they just took the day off a little sore On if he likes the new cutdown rules I do I do I do because I mentioned this before I just think that we have had these guys for so long that this is a great opportunity for a lot of them to play and show what they have not just for our team and our practice squad but for everybody else If you make a mad cut after the Thursday game or after our game against Cincinnati youre not going to be able to really pick anybody up You dont have the roster spots and then you dont have enough guys to play against Tampa because youre going to rest all your starters So it is great to have all these guys available and its great to see them play You give them an opportunity to see what they have in a pro stadium and a big game On his memories of last years game against Tampa Bay which was moved a day earlier because of Tropical Depression Nine That was a grind It was tough a tough week But we got through it and guys adjusted well They actually played well Mack Brown had a big game and did some good things We were able to look at a lot of good players On if he had previously played or coached in circumstances like that In a hurricane No That would be the first On if the team could look to add defensive linemen after roster cuts Yeah could be I think our scouts upstairs are looking at everybodys roster and projected cuts and seeing if there is somebody we could pick up that can help our football team well look at them Also for practice squad purposes But we feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Ive said that from day one I think with Joey Mbu and AJ Francis theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth But obviously if somebody they feel like is better well take a look On if he expects there to be a lot of fluctuation on the roster once all teams have cut from 90 to 53 Could be You know I dont anticipate a whole lot but you dont know Weve got to wait and see whos out there Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have On CB Joshua Holsey Ive been impressed with Josh Hes played nickel hes played corner Hes active Hes a good tackler Hes not the biggest guy in the world but he makes up for it with his smarts He knows where to go and where to be and has great coverage skills in my opinion I like his toughness I like his attitude and hes done well both inside and outside On which offensive coaches help in the booth Coach Matt Cavanaugh is up there He does good And then we have Kevin OConnell downstairs and obviously Wes Phillips downstairs and Coach Bill Callahan downstairs On if calling plays detracts from his time with the defense No I didnt spend a lot of time with them last year Every once in a while Id just pat them on the head and say good job or yell at them if they werent hustling I stay out of the schematics part of it Theyve already got all that stuff and the defensive coaches do an excellent job so well just let them do their job On areas in which RB Chris Thompson has improved this offseason Oh wow I think last year he was very good in his role I think we can expand his role if we want to Its just hes so good at the thirddown role that I just want to keep him there Hes a very valuable commodity to our football team both in pass protection and getting out on the routes I mean the thought of him not being around scares the heck out of me So hes improved every part of his game and a lot of these young players they do that You either get better or worse and hes just one of those guys that continues to work and hes gotten better at everything His vision on the running game and his pass protection has gotten better and better and his routes really are the most improved I think coming out of the backfield It takes some time for those guys to work their releases and work on the linebackers and run them at the right depth and come out at the right angles and all that stuff and hes darnnear perfected it',\n",

RedskinsBuccaneers Ingredients For Victory is presented by Papa Johns Every Monday after a Redskins game get a Large Cheese Pizza for just 999 Receive a FREE TOPPING for every Redskins touchdown DOUBLE THE FREE TOPPINGS when the Redskins win TIME FOR THE SUDFELD SHOW The plan for Thursdays preseason finale against the Buccaneers as was the case last year is to have Nate Sudfeld start and play the entire game at quarterback Since being selected in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft last year Sudfeld has been Washingtons No 3 quarterback behind Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy His reps are few and far between as the third string quarterback so Thursday will show just how much hes progressed in the past year The thing about Nate is that Colt and Kirk are very selfish when it comes to reps so he doesnt get a lot said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden So this is a great opportunity for him to show what he can do Hes had a few sprinkled in here he played I think half against Baltimore Week 1 sparingly he didnt play last week and he played sparingly Week 2 so well see how he does All those roster decisions they are going to come up come Friday morning when we get back So far this preseason Sudfeld has completed 11of23 passes for 132 yards along with five rushing yards Last year the Indiana product capped off his first preseason completing eight passes for 72 yards and a touchdown in a driving rainstorm at Raymond James Stadium ENCORE PERFORMANCE FOR MACK In that rainy weather last year Washington was able to show the depth of the running back position with Mack Brown 149 and Rob Kelley 99 rushing for a combined 248 yards It was the conclusion of a training camp battle that would see Kelley edge out Brown for a spot on the Redskins first 53man roster But Brown would reemerge after spending the first half of the year on the practice squad In a Week 16 victory over the Chicago Bears Brown rushed for a gamehigh 82 yards 61 of which came on a fourth quarter touchdown run With Kelley Chris Thompson and rookie Samaje Perine expected locks on the active roster this year Browns performance against the Buccaneers on Thursday could go a long way into Washingtons brass needing to keep four running backs up During the offseason Brown cut down on his body fat while honing in on improved agility and speed through the help of players like LeSean McCoy and Tevin Coleman His hope is that itll result in a stronger 2017 campaign You watch Thompson every day and see that he is quick but then you see McCoy and I have never seen feet like that in person before Brown said He would just tell me think about Kobe Bryant Kobe worked on his shot every day his dribble every day post moves so why not work on your cuts every day He was right I lift and run but I dont do footwork every day He said he works on his balance and footwork every day so he can come out his cuts better So ever since then I have been working on coming out my cuts and balance drills THE SEARCH FOR THE RIGHT COMBINATION COMES TO A CLOSE While training camp and the preseason can tell a story for how reps will be delved out during the regular season for most position groups that isnt the case for the defensive linemen Under new defensive line coach Jim Tomsula the Redskins have tried just about every combination possible with the linemen on the 90man roster Washington of course lost Phil Taylor Sr for the season with a torn quad tendon The veteran was atop the depth chart at the nose tackle position So how players like Joey Mbu and AJ Francis perform against the Buccaneers could help in final decisions for which defensive linemen to keep on the 53man roster We feel good about the depth we have at the defensive line Gruden said Ive said that from day one I think with Joey and AJ theyre playing well Obviously Matt Ioannidis is playing well and Stacy McGee and youve got Terrell McClain and Ziggy Hood so weve got a good group Anthony Lanier is young and hes still getting better So we feel pretty good about our depth ONE LAST IMPRESSION Less than 48 hours after the opening kickoff goes into the air at Raymond James Stadium Washington will have to slice down the roster from 90 players to 53 There will certainly be difficult decisions for the front office as is the case every year and there will be nerves for the players on the bubble But Grudens hope is that everyone who dresses the starters likely wont have their best performance yet Obviously were excited to see how these guys play Gruden said Last week a lot of them didnt get a lot of chances to play This is a good week for them to show how much theyve learned throughout the OTAs and training camp and now its their opportunity to play well against a good Tampa team Not a lot of preparation time obviously which is a negative for them but we hope that the fundamentals that weve taught and the plays that we have should be good versus everything and well see how they react and adjust For the pro scouts theyll have a busy weekend ahead but Gruden is confident the staff is prepared to assemble the best 53man roster Like I said the scouts know them all a lot better than I do right at this second so well get a look at whos out there and if we feel like they can make our team better well look at them Gruden said But I feel good about the guys were going to keep I dont want to let any of these guys go right now but were going to have to make those tough decisions I like the guys that we have and I think we can compete with the ones that we have',\n",

catch the football and pass protect Im very fortunate to play with the guys that I do And understand guys Im talking to my teammates and the people in this room the best way to help this Charitable

has started the last 96 games Hes also recorded at least 75 sacks in all six of his seasons The 2016 season though was one of Kerrigans best yet as he one again paced the defensive unit with 11 sacks the secondhighest total of his career along with two passes defensed and two fumbles forced But while Kerrigan was once again a quiet leader he credited his coaches and fellow outside linebackers for the award I want to thank my coaches and teammates for making this possible Kerrigan said I think this award is a representation of how we performed as outside linebackers last year A Breakout

       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins preseason Week 4 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that took place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Fla 1 Nate Sudfeld puts together a solid final preseason showing With Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy taking the majority of practice and preseason reps over the last few months Sudfeld finally got his chance to see extended action on the field for the Redskins and he did not disappoint Exactly one year after his last start Sudfeld completed 22of33 passes for 278 yards along with two carries for four yards in a 1310 victory over the Buccaneers I thought it was a pretty solid night pretty efficient for the most part in terms of moving the ball Sudfeld said But disappointed that we werent able to get more points for whatever reason we were kind of getting bogged down at the end of drives but we were moving the ball which is good But again we need to finish So it was a solid night overall but a lot to improve on Not only was Sudfeld able to get the Redskins moving the secondyear Indiana product completed passes to 11 different players four of which recorded at least 30 receiving yards It was important for Sudfeld to have a good final outing with the roster being sized down to 53 players on Saturday afternoon With Sudfeld serving as the No 3 quarterback last year he was inactive for all 16 games So he understands that he doesnt have a ton of job security Theyre never easy Sudfeld said of roster cut deadlines You know whether you make the squad or not like last year I made the squad and so many of my good buddies didnt so its tough regardless So Im going to be there probably hanging out with some of my buddies my brother will be in town so well hang out and maybe go golfing or something probably try to get my mind off it but Ill see what happens 2 Mack Brown confident he made an impression With the Redskins top three running backs consider locks for the 53man roster Brown was one of many players on Thursday night putting the finishing touches on what they hope is enough positive tape to get active status In total Brown carried the ball 18 times for a gamehigh 69 yards One game doesnt determine my fate Brown said Ive been going hard ever since Day 1 at camp Whatever happens happens Ill leave my hand in Gods hands Im encouraged Im not discouraged Im thankful Brown was a numbers game cut last year for the first 53man roster but the University of Florida product eventually got his number called again in Week 8 last year While he was just a special teams contributor for most of the season he did record a 61yard touchdown against the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 victory Even if it isnt in Washington Brown believes hell be on an NFL roster once again this season I will be playing football somewhere this year Brown said I know that for a fact because God told me last night So whatever happens happens Like I said before I will always be a Redskin no matter what gives Not having a college career being fourthstring in my senior year they gave me a chance that nobody else did so Im thankful and Ill always love the Redskins I feel like the Redskins will win the Super Bowl this year 3 In a crowded wide receivers room Matt Hazel saved his biggest game for last Just as is the case at so many other positions for the Redskins this year the wide receivers group is loaded with talent Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and Jamison Crowder are all expected to get their targets and Ryan Grant remains someone the coaching staff is high on Beyond those four though the Redskins have eight other players on the 90man roster trying to make the active squad Among them is Matt Hazel a player who spent the majority of last season on the practice squad During Thursday nights game Hazel was the most productive wide receiver for both teams catching all four of his targets for a gamehigh 60 yards I felt like I was so locked in Hazel said I didnt really keep count Nate did a great job weve been talking the whole week we were trying to connect Then I didnt really get too many opportunities with him in the first couple games and not really too much on practice But we hooked up and I think that was just good communication throughout the week understanding what we see we did a good job watching film breaking these guys down and made some plays Hazels best catch of the night came on a 23yard reception in which he dragged both feet to secure the ball inbounds That was an incredible catch Sudfeld said I just tried to get my back shoulder throw it where they aint as we say throw it where theyre not So he made a great catch on it and I would like to see some of those on film I havent really seen them 4 Josh HarveyClemons comes through with the top defensive play of the night In a game were neither offense could get into the end zone through the first three quarters HarveyClemons finally logged the nights first touchdown on a 41yard picksix Tampa Bay quarterback Sifo Liufau tried to roll out on a play action pass and complete a pass to one of his wide receivers but the rookie linebacker took advantage of a an overthrown pass coupled with solid downfield blocking by the defense to score Its something we work on with the linebackers all the time HarveyClemons said Once you feel the flow of the running back and its a play action turn and find the crossing receiver and I got up under him and the quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play HarveyClemons felt putting the turnover on tape was important as he missed on other plays earlier in the game I missed a couple of sacks at the beginning and I was kind of down about that but its part of the game HarveyClemons said You just have to keep playing the next play and our defense played great and we held up tonight and thats all you can ask for 5 The Redskins have less than 48 hours before the initial 53man roster is set With the conclusion of Thursday nights game the Redskins are one step closer to the regular season But before they practice once again nearly half of the team will either be released or waived It is a tough reality in the NFL but one players arent unfamiliar with Still it makes the next few days very difficult Ive built a lot of relationships Brown said Like I said before Im thankful and were always going to be friends The guys that became friends were going to be friends after this Im just thankful to be on the field with you guys for the last time For Hazel meanwhile he said the wide receivers have never viewed it as a competition We just support each other when they make plays Hazel said Brian Quick James Quick made plays today Jamari Staples even got out there and made a couple plays So you just cheer your teammates on and really try to show some leadership Really thats it I dont ever really look at it like competition nothing like that Head coach Jay Gruden said the team will be ready to assemble the best 53man roster possible We have a full staff thats on board with that theyve been watching Gruden said of Saturdays cutdown process From training camp on they have been studying other teams We are not just going to wait for the waiver wire and look at it and say Oh my gosh these guys prepared They are anticipating what is going to happen around the league and there will be a few surprises

Cousins Colt McCoy Final Cuts 1 Nate Sudfeld Analysis As has been the case over the last twoplus years now Cousins is Washingtons starting quarterback with McCoy who has started 25 games in his NFL career serving as a veteran backup But for the first time in a few years now Washington has elected to go with just two quarterbacks on the initial 53man roster as they have waived Sudfeld a 2016 sixthround pick Sudfeld was on the active roster for the entirety of his rookie season but did not dress in any of the Redskins 16 regular season games The Indiana product did start Washingtons preseason finale on Thursday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers completing 22of33 passes for 228 yards Even though he was among the players waived by Washington on Saturday the team remains high on his development and could bring him back on the practice squad Running Backs 4 Rob Kelley Samaje Perine Chris Thompson Mack Brown Final Cuts 2 Matt Jones Kenny Hilliard Analysis Just as they did during the final months of the regular season last year the Redskins will carry four running backs on the active roster Kelley of course returns as the teams starting running back and head coach Jay Gruden is steadfast in his praise of Thompson in the thirddown back role Washington also brought in Perine during the 2017 NFL Draft as the 5foot11 236pound bruiser provides Washington with a short yardage back that could solve some of the red zone struggles from 2016 While it was assumed all three would be on the active roster to start the year Brown was able to push his way back into the fold Brown may not have his number called early on the offensive side of the ball as the likely No 4 running back but he plays a vital role on special teams I liked what he brought to the team on special teams Gruden said last month Then he had a big breakout run against Chicago which was excellent Hes progressing Jones meanwhile was waived following two seasons in Washington after the Redskins selected him in the third round of the 2015 NFL Draft The University of Florida product started the first seven games last year as the replacement for Alfred Morris but injuries and ball security issues coupled with the rise in production from Kelley resulted in the 24year old being inactive for the final nine games of the season Wide Receivers 5 Jamison Crowder Josh Doctson Terrelle Pryor Sr Ryan Grant Brian Quick Final Cuts 7 Robert Davis Maurice Harris Matt Hazel Levern Jacobs Zach Pascal James Quick Jamari Staples Analysis At one of the deepest position groups for the Redskins Washington is electing to start the season with five wide receivers as returners Crowder Grant and Doctson are joined this season by Pryor and Quick Washingtons top four receivers of Crowder Doctson Pryor and Grant seemingly were locked in but there was a tight battle for that last spot Quick edged out Davis and Harris though among others The veteran is coming off a career best season with the Los Angeles Rams as he recorded 41 receptions for 564 yards and three touchdowns As for the three starters on Washingtons unofficial depth chart Doctson Crowder and Pryor the hope is that the trio can produce in similar fashion to the way Crowder Pierre Garon and DeSean Jackson did last year Despite the Redskins waiving seven receivers Washington has ample options for the practice squad Davis was a sixthround pick in this years draft and had a strong showing during training camp Robert has done some good things not just catching the ball but blocking Ive been impressed with him Gruden said Were trying to run the ball Any time you want to be a physical running football team you have to have physical receivers to go in there and block safeties from time to time sometimes even linebackers Robert has proven he can do that Hes not afraid thats for sure Harris meanwhile went from practice squad to active roster last season recording eight receptions for 66 yards in 10 games while Hazel spent the final two months of 2016 on Washingtons practice squad Tight Ends 4 Jordan Reed Vernon Davis Niles Paul Jeremy Sprinkle Final Cuts 2 Manasseh Garner EJ Bibbs Analysis Just prior to Saturdays cutdown deadline the Redskins announced that they acquired a seventhround selection from the Rams in exchange for Derek Carrier Carrier spent two seasons with the Redskins and looked solid in his lone full offseason on the field in Washington but with so much depth at the position the team received compensation for the Beloit College product instead of outright releasing him As for the four tight ends that are on the active roster position coach Wes Phillips believes it is the deepest tight ends group in the NFL today and itd be hard to argue against that Reed of course is among the best at the position today while Davis has experienced a renaissance of sorts in Washington Last year the veteran recorded 44 receptions for 583 yards and two touchdowns Paul meanwhile can play multiple positions on offense including fullback while remaining one of the Redskins best special teams players Rounding out the group is Sprinkle a fifthround selection out of Arkansas While the 6foot5 252 pounder can be a pass catching threat Gruden believes Sprinkle is going to be a Y tight end in this league for a very long time Hes going to get stronger and stronger every year and hes got very good hands Gruden said Hes got deceptive speed but you really like him as an inline blocker Offensive Linemen 8 Shawn Lauvao Spencer Long Morgan Moses Ty Nsekhe Brandon Scherff Trent Williams Chase Roullier Tyler Catalina Final Cuts 8 Lucas Crowley Kyle Kalis John Kling Arie Kouandjio Kendall Pace Vinston Painter Ronald Patrick Isaiah Williams Analysis The Redskins return their starting offensive line from a year ago with Williams a fivetime Pro Bowler leading the way but theres two new faces in the room Roullier and Catalina have cracked the active roster as rookies although the two joined the Redskins on different paths Roullier is a sixthround pick out of Wyoming that has been thrusted into the spotlight recently with Long sidelined by a knee injury The 24yearold started Washingtons preseason Week 3 game against the Cincinnati Bengals and appeared on 40 snaps with the firstteam offensive unit He didnt look out of place against an aggressive Bengals frontseven just as he hadnt at all during training camp Hes done a great job he really has Gruden said For a rookie to come in here and handle all the things he has to handle its been very impressive Chase has got a ways to go obviously but hes on the right track Hes a true center He might have to play a little bit of guard from time to time If hes going to dress on game day hes going to have to back up guard and center So well get him going but the starting point is to really find a good center As for Catalina he joined Washingtons roster as a college free agent signing in May He has the versatility to play multiple spots along the line as was the case against the Buccaneers when he played at right tackle left tackle and right guard DEFENSE Defensive Linemen 6 Jonathan Allen Ziggy Hood Anthony Lanier II Stacy McGee Terrell McClain Matt Ioannidis Final Cuts 4 Brandon Banks Joey Mbu Ondre Pipkins AJ Francis Analysis One of the most difficult positions to gauge in terms of roster decisions throughout the preseason the defensive lines standing became a little bit clearer on Saturday with the decision to keep six defensive linemen on the active roster Hood returns as the elder statesman of the group as the 30yearold can play both end positions and nose tackle The Redskins also return secondyear linemen in the form of Lanier and Ioannidis both of whom the coaching staff is looking for an uptick in production this year Hes gotten a lot stronger in the weight room Gruden said of Ioannidis a fifthround pick for Washington last year Its kind of what I was hoping Getting him out of Temple hes just a big strong guy He works hard in the weight room Its led by Ziggy Hood Hes a great example for those guys those young guys with his work habits in the weight room He takes them all under his wing and Matts one of those guys thats just gotten so much stronger He gets great push in the pocket and hes playing good against the run so Ive been impressed with Matt McGee and McClain were signed within the first 24 hours of free agency opening up this year and the Redskins believe Allen can be a gamechanging player for years to come Everything that Ive seen so far from him from as a person character standpoint and athletic ability has been what we thought so hes going to be great addition for us for a long time Gruden said during training camp Any time youve got a big guy that can rush as a threetechnique this day and age especially third down thats a huge benefit for us He also is excellent against the run I think he proved that at Alabama his last year He was kind of known as just a pass rusher his junior year and then he came back his senior year and wanted to show people he was really a good run defender and he did that Allaround defensive end defensive tackle its going to really help us Linebackers 10 Ryan Kerrigan Zach Brown Mason Foster Preston Smith Will Compton Martrell Spaight Chris Carter Josh HarveyClemons Junior Galette Ryan Anderson Final Cuts 5 Nico Marley Pete Robertson Ron Thompson Jr Lynden Trail Zach Vigil Analysis In terms of the outside linebackers this group is once again headlined by Kerrigan a twotime Pro Bowler who is already third alltime in franchise history in sacks This year he is joined once again by Smith along with Carter Galette and Anderson After spending his first two seasons in Washington on Injured Reserve with Achilles tears Galette finally returned to the field last weekend and showed some of his famous burst off the line With Trent Murphy sidelined for the year theyll need a healthy and productive Galette on game days At inside linebacker the Redskins are still determining how the depth will stack up there but Foster and Brown started the second and third preseason games HarveyClemons cracked the 53man roster after capping off his first NFL preseason slate with a 41yard picksix Thursday night The college safety is still trying to adjust to a new position as a dime linebacker but he was happy to showcase his progress with the interception Its something we work on as linebackers all the time HarveyClemons said of the play Once you feel the flow of the running back and its a play action I turned found the crossing receiver and I got up under him The quarterback I dont know if he saw me or not but he threw it right to me and I had great blockers on the play Cornerbacks 6 Josh Norman Bashaud Breeland Quinton Dunbar Fabian Moreau Joshua Holsey Kendall Fuller Final Cuts 2 Tevin Homer Jeremiah McKinnon Analysis While Norman and Breeland are the starters once again on the outside Washingtons depth at this position really impressed during training camp Fuller took over the nickel cornerback position at the start of camp and looked more comfortable with a fully healthy offseason under his belt Last year the 2016 thirdround pick was still recovering from a torn ACL that limited his speed some I think hes more confident in the injury that hes coming off of Gruden said He looks stronger he looks faster so its good to see Hes moving around also hes playing some nickel playing some corner and hes doing a fine job Moreau meanwhile flashed in Washingtons second preseason game against the Green Bay Packers with two big special teams plays while also showing the ability to hang with speedy wide receivers Its no joke what hes putting out there on the field Norman said of Moreau Obviously hes going to be a great talent in this league to come But hes still going to work on some things Well get him better each and every day Hes going to work with us Were going to get him to the level he needs to be Safeties 5 DJ Swearinger Sua Cravens Deshazor Everett Montae Nicholson Stefan McClure Final Cuts 2 Will Blackmon Fish Smithson Analysis Just as Everett did two years ago although at the cornerback position McClure has made the active roster after being signed during training camp In Washingtons four preseason games McClure recorded 11 tackles along with two passes defensed ad a sack This position group though features Swearinger and Cravens Swearinger was one of Washingtons free agent additions and has provided the defense with a vocal leader Im a natural leader from birth Swearinger said My mom told me that been telling me that all my life You know she told me to lead not to follow and lead first and foremost and thats what you know a lot of the energy the excitement and when we get people lined up thats where a lot of that comes from Cravens meanwhile has moved back to safety after spending his rookie season at inside linebacker SPECIAL TEAMS Kicker 1 Dustin Hopkins Final

the thrill of seeing their team pick up its first victory of the season in thrilling fashion against the Rams scoring a goahead touchdown and intercepting a pass to seal the game in the final minutes It was another example of the Redskins resiliency coming up big on the road in a game that felt necessary to win These road games provide unique traveling experiences ones that occur at least eight times each season which are nothing new but are rarely documented When does a team get to its predetermined location How do players approach each part of their journeys What seat on the plane do they

before the long flight ahead My headphones making sure my phone is charged just trying to make sure to get the little stuff taken care of he says Im just thinking about the game and things about what I need to do to be influential in the game while Im on the flight Crowder says 2 300 pm Friday Board plane at Dulles International Airport As the season progresses and it gets a little colder Crowder will opt for a blazer But on a relatively warm day and nearly five hours of sitting inside a plane awaiting him Crowders priority is feeling comfortable Thats why he goes with just a shirt as he walks up the plane steps I wanted to look as presentable as possible without wearing a suit because I knew the flight was going to be long he says I wanted to feel comfortable So I made sure that was one of the things that I kept in mind was that to wear a nice shirt nice jeans nice pair of dress shoes and still be comfortable I made sure that I tried to look as clean as possible 3 315 pm Friday On the plane Crowder is assigned a window seat which suits him just fine He starts off the trip with some music Obviously Im a big J Cole fan so I listened to some of his albums some of his mixtapes and then decides to watch the movie Hidden Figures About midway through I ended up falling asleep so Im going to have to go back and watch the end because I dont know what happened But it seemed like a pretty good movie up to the point that I didnt watch Crowder says Im definitely going to have to finish that Once I woke up I probably had another hourandahalf or so until we landed I just put back on my music for the time being and that was pretty much it Once we got to the West Coast once we got closer over there I turned on some Kendrick Lamar I was trying to get into my West Coast vibes 4 615 pm Friday Arrive at hotel Marina Del Ray Calif For dinner that night Crowder heads out to Santa Monica with fellow wide receiver Josh Doctson whose favorite restaurant is Del Friscos Thats definitely his favorite Crowder says I mean its alright I like it its pretty good but thats definitely Doctsons favorite restaurant After dinner both of them walk over to the Santa Monica pier where they meet up with wide receiver Brian Quick We chilled out there for a little bit and then just went back to the hotel after that he says I just laid down and stayed in the room pretty much for the rest of the evening 5 100 pm Saturday Bus to UCLA for practice The work doesnt end on Saturday The team has its usual walkthrough practice scheduled but because theyre in a new city they must borrow a practice field This time UCLA comes to the rescue offering up their facility for the team to get in sync one last time before Sundays game They had a really nice facility from the little bit that we saw Crowder says I think that whole bus ride there from the hotel to the facility was pretty cool because you get a chance to kind of see the difference get views of the different landscapes of LA Me being from the south and being used to more land and more open areas seeing LA and all the houses and stuff right close together and all the palm trees and all that kind of stuff it was a cool bus ride from the hotel to the practice field Once I got there UCLA has a really nice facility and it was pretty cool 6 230 pm Saturday Return to hotel After the team returns from walkthrough practice players have their options to find dinner and prepare for the game ahead Crowder meets up with a friend who worked in Los Angeles and the two walk down the street to grab some dinner and talk for some more in the hotel lobby Then its time to relax For the most part on Saturday I just try to chill out and stay off my feet as much as possible and really just do the things I need to do to get my body ready for the game he says Whatever hotel were in I make sure I have my bag of epsom salts and always run me a warm bath just to kind of loosen up my muscles and everything the night before 7 915 am Sunday Board bus to Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Better rested than the previous night and with the jet lag not as strong some players rise early and head to the buses parked outside the hotel Now is the time for focus to go over everything that has been covered and practiced during the week Im just thinking about the game Crowder says of his mindset on the bus Just trying to let the game play in my mind just trying to pump myself up making sure that Im on the details of whatever plays notes that Im going through from over the week from practice just a last checkup to make sure Im good Other than that its just go out there and make plays have fun dont get to caught up into it At the end of the day its a game Its a job but its a game so go out there and have fun and make plays 8 125 pm Sunday Game begins vs Los Angeles Rams The Redskins defeat the Rams 2720 to collect their first victory of the season Crowder grabs four passes for 47 yards picking up a key first down on the final gamewinning drive of the day The experience of playing in the Coliseum is notable for a variety of reasons We were warming up out there and I was actually thinking about the movie Money Talks a movie with Chris Tucker Crowder says At the end of the movie Chris Tucker took this French guys diamonds and had them hidden at the Coliseum Theres a part in the movie towards the end I kind of laughed to myself Chris Tucker grabs the diamonds and yells to the French guy Is this what you want So he takes the diamonds and just tosses them and throws them down the Coliseum steps You have to see the movie So I was thinking about that But it was cool playing there for the first time and I was just glad we could get the win 9 625 pm Sunday Board plane at LAX After changing back into their casual clothes players walk up the Coliseum tunnel board the buses and depart for the airport Awaiting them is another fourhourplus flight home but this one will be much sweeter Its definitely better when you win Its not as bad he says I knew it was a long flight Like I said I made sure that I had my headphones my phone charged up put back on my music I ended up taking a nap and fell asleep for much of the flight It was uncomfortable but I stayed asleep I didnt even watch a movie this time I played a little bit of solitaire By the time I woke up we were getting ready to land So the flight was a little easier coming back after the win Another road trip in the books',\n",

       " 'The Washington Redskins found their security blanket in Chris Thompson an excellent third down back who signed a multiyear contract extension on Tuesday Chris Thompson can finally relax knowing his home will continue to reside in Washington for at least another few years The 26yearold running back signed a contract extension Tuesday something he said had been making him nervous for days now I felt like a kid going to school for the first day Thompson said I couldnt sleep I was ready to give up and come here this morning I wanted to cry last night because I knew this was coming this morning Little bit of mixed emotions but of course Im happy about it Thompson had been previously playing under a oneyear tender he signed in the offseason Now that a longerterm deal has been inked Thompson expressed his eagerness to focus purely on football Im just glad we were able to get something done and thats out the window now he said I wasnt worried about it earlier I was just focusing on having a great year this year but now thats out of the way I feel good Thompsons transition to the NFL was anything but smooth after being drafted by the Redskins in the fifth round in 2013 During his rookie season the young tailback underwent shoulder surgery keeping him off the field for a large portion of the year He failed to make the initial 53man roster in 2014 and spent time on the practice squad before finally getting an opportunity to see some game time later that year His amount of carries nearly doubled from 2015 to 2016 and he averaged 55 yards per run through the two seasons earning him the title of security blanket on the offense Just being consistent thats been my biggest focus just trying to be consistent and just being the same guy being the same player every single day Thompson said Head coach Jay Gruden one of Thompsons advocates expressed his delight in the extension and praised his running backs work ethic Hes a coachs dream quite frankly and you want those guys to succeed because it trickles down in the building Gruden said Guys like that when you see them get rewarded the younger guys see what it takes to get rewarded and it rubs off on the younger players So its great to have a leader like Chris Gruden also said that while there may be some bigger names at running back on the roster there were few more dependable than Thompson especially in the red zone and on third down Through four seasons Thompson also acted as another weapon for quarterback Kirk Cousins in the passing game snagging 90 receptions and five touchdowns Weve gotten to the point where Kirk trusted me Thompson said Thats what every receiver running back wants from their quarterback to just have that trust in you The coaches trust in me and thats all I ever wanted Though he received support and encouragement from the coaching staff and team during the offseason Thompson said there was hardly ever a moment where he felt his job was completely secure He said he recognized the uncertainty that comes with playing in the NFL but was glad to have a home for the next two years I had my doubts I had them all along ever since I made it in this league Thompson said I started to improve my last couple years so I figured something would come along and we were finally able to get something done Like I said before Im happy about it Im excited about the opportunity to be here with my boys a little longer',\n",

       " 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Hes done a better job handling the burnout from preseasons past One of the concerns that quarterback Kirk Cousins had after last season was his stamina He noticed that he didnt balance his time and energy in the most efficient way leaving him feeling a little burned out facing the Steelers for the season opener As part of his ongoing evolution as a starting quarterback Cousins took better care of himself during training camp and the preseason managing how much energy he exerted throughout the grind of August I would say Ive done a better job managing it Cousins said I feel that each year Im going to get better at handling my role and how to be best prepared each week Its been a good offseason Im ready to go Feel like the last six weeks through training camp and through preseason games its never been perfect but its been a good six weeks Weve done all we can to be ready for this first game Cousins did also mention that while his wife is expecting a baby very soon he will react accordingly which is a different kind of preparation I think the plan is to not have a plan Cousins said In a sense that if I can be there Im going to be there if I cant I cant Im going to get there as fast as I can whenever my commitment is over 2 Hes still comfortable with Josh Doctson despite not playing with him much over the past month The most concern the offense might still have is how wide receiver Josh Doctson will fare after a lingering hamstring injury has sidelined him for most of the preseason Hes missed all but three games over the last year including a preseason game this year which has cut down on time Cousins has had to gain a rapport with him Still Cousins says hes comfortable with Doctson lining up with the offense crediting his natural abilities as a receiver to help transcend the time lost He was able to watch last year and sit in on meetings and learn our offense Cousins said He knows what it should look like he watched some really good players some veteran players do it last year It doesnt take a lot of time to get him going We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here We just got to continue to get him opportunities As for what kind of natural instincts Doctson has shown Cousins had a long list Natural hands tracks the ball well Hes got good speed he jumps well great size long arms Cousins said Smart player laidback personality doesnt take things too seriously in the sense that he just goes out there and enjoys the game and plays He tracks the ball really well in the air which is a tough skill to be able to have 3 The Eagles pass rush is something Cousins always has to respect Cousins said he could talk a lot about what the Eagles do on defense but he emphasized the pass rush not just the players such as Fletcher Cox but the scheme Ive always respected Coach Schwartz and their defense and the way they come after you Cousins said Just constantly put pressure even sometimes with only three or four rushers you still feel them Ive always respected Malcolm Jenkins as a safety and really the entire unit I think Jordan Hicks is a very good Mike linebacker hes a smart player you can tell hes a good leader for them Mychal Kendricks has always been a guy that plays fast plays downhill hell strike you Just a lot of respect all the way around Very versatile players that can do multiple things Its going to be a good challenge While the Redskins have won the last five games against the Eagles and Cousins has found success he also knows that the Eagles have played intelligently against them When you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience he said Its going to be a really good challenge and its what you expect Week 1 RedskinsEagles I think itll live up to how intense you expect it to be 4 He feels very good about his third down options with everyone healthy on the firstteam offense Its no question Cousins is feeling more assured about Sunday knowing he will have all of his offensive weapons at his disposal Injuries for the most part have subsided in time for the opener and while there hasnt been much time to find a rhythm Cousins is looking forward to seeing what he can do with his numerous options Part of the equation will be relying on tight end Jordan Reed and running back Chris Thompson on third downs two players who have become reliable targets when the offense is in a bind and needs a first down I dont feel a need to go look elsewhere to find somebody in those two roles Cousins said Both very natural great players Im sure it helps to have other guys who complement them Chris Thompson outside with Terrelle Pryor Sr and Josh Doctson and Ryan Grant and on and on Vernon Davis When you can have other guys thrown into the mix it hopefully keeps defenses guessing opens up lanes for Jamison Crowder and Jordan Theyre a big help to our offense They show up in big moments thats what great players do Were going to need them to do that on Sunday If we can stay healthy its going to give us a major advantage later in the year We work for that train for that and we do have some depth thats going to be an advantage for us hopefully down the road Id like to think we get all of our guys going spread the ball around let them all show what they can do and give us a lot that the defense has to focus on 5 Cousins has a new nook and personal office space at the facility and hes very excited about it Cousins posted a photo on Instagram recently about his excitement over a new small office at the Redskins facility It provides Cousins an opportunity to prepare somewhere other than the quarterbacks room which he cedes to other position groups during the week Now he has all of his papers and binders and fun trinkets in one spot and he couldnt help but smile about all of it on Wednesday I like a place to kind of leave my stuff and have notes and a white board and thoughts that I can have organized old binders that I have kept and just have them stock piled up Cousins said There really wasnt a place to do that that I could have access to it at all times We found an old nook is the best word I can think of Its really not an office but it works for me Ms Bj our secretary did a good job of getting it dressed up for me and we have talked about maybe putting saloon doors on it because there are no doors right now We were told we wont be able to put a door on it so maybe saloon doors or maybe hippie beads coming down from the ceiling I dont know On his desk sits a Jeff Foxworthy peel off calendar some Michael Scott toys from The Office and a white board with a quote from Muhammad Ali Essentially it says the fight is won or lost long before I dance under the lights Cousins said That is what he used to say so I put that there just as a reminder when Im in there that often times the game can be won or lost right here when you see something or you find a tip or a piece of information that can make a difference So it is just a good reminder I thought it was a fitting quote for what that room should be about',\n",

       " 'After being cut by the Falcons last week quarterback Alek Torgensen received a spot on the Redskins practice squad where he will begin his development at the position Upon his release from the Atlanta Falcons last Friday Alek Torgersen flew to New York City with a bag packed of essentials to visit some friends He waited for his phone to ring not sure if any NFL team would give him another shot until Sunday when the Redskins offered the rookie quarterback a spot on their practice squad I got the call to come here and I was ready to go my bags were packed nice easy flight from New York and it was a lot of fun he said after his first day of practice A whirlwind of emotions the lowest lows and the highest highs its been a crazy experience so far Had that call not taken place had the Redskins not waived quarterback Nate Sudfeld and no other teams found his talents necessary Torgersen was ready to travel to Oslo Norway where his father was born raised and now lives coaching a womens crew team Now hell wait to go at a later date Torgersen grew up in the same house in Huntington Beach Calif for the first 18 years of his life his mother is from Orange County but he has made numerous visits to Norway where his grandmother and aunt still live as well Despite the 12hour flights from California he tries to go back as often as possible to see them because they havent been around that much in my life said Torgersen who has never spoken the language fluently His visits provide him a unique cultural perspective that might help him as he learns to adapt to another culture in Washington For now he is understandably taking things one day at a time as he adjusts to a new environment learns a new playbook and gets to know his new teammates The University of Pennsylvania product played in the EastWest Shrine game thats where he first caught head coach Jay Grudens eyes but didnt receive an invitation to the NFL Combine in February He had to rely on a body of work that he accrued over four years in Philadelphia and a Pro Day workout throwing to receivers he hadnt played with before His credentials include being Penns alltime leader in passing touchdowns 52 completion percentage 651 and total offense 7937 yards along with being a twotime firstteam AllIvy selection I think at Penn he had a good career and then I watched every throw that he had in the EastWest Shrine game and I thought he had a good quick arm and an accurate arm Gruden said The Redskins had thought about bringing him in after the draft but were hesitant about having four quarterbacks on the roster Instead the Falcons gave him a chance signing him as a college free agent but with Matt Ryan and Matt Schaub just recently signing a contract extension ahead of him his only opportunity was to impress coaches enough so they might consider a third spot on the quarterback depth chart In three preseason games Torgersen was afforded just 20 pass attempts completing eight of them for 95 yards with two interceptions With little opportunity to find a rhythm his introduction to the NFL has been turbulent and even Torgersen said that theres a lot of mystery about me right now Coming from college to the pros its a big jump Torgersen said Youre going to take a big leap right away I felt like I made a very large leap in my game I got a lot better but I need to push myself a little more to get a little more better Initially its going to be big and these next steps are going to be smaller so youve got to look at that and find what youre doing well and remember that you are doing better Torgersens biggest goals are to work on the mental aspects of his game namely making better and faster reads and increasing his foot speed but he believes he has the talent to play in the league The adjustments will happen through osmosis experiencing an entire season with Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy asking for help and knowing that his development wont be rushed I asked him today I said Is your head spinning or how do you feel Hes handling it well Cousins said It is a lot to pick up He does a good job of understanding a lot of the big terms and techniques he really has picked it up quickly The challenge is in all the little nuances That takessometimes years Cousins even said hes been picking Torgersons brain a little bit about Atlantas offensive schemes and is enjoying meeting new people collecting new people to be able to have those relationships and hear their story and learn from them Kirks generally taken an interest in my life wanted to get to know me Torgersen said So I look forward to getting to know him a little better in these next couple months and just happy to be here Because of this new job hell postpone that trip to see his father a former crew star himself coaching at his former club in Oslo at least until the offseason Torgersen said hes not sure if he could handle crew himself but had considered taking it up if football didnt pan out after high school So far football has panned out Enough to give him another chance in the NFL Its going to take a little time a little bit of an adjustment period for me but Im ready to take on the challenge Torgersen said Its a lot fun to learn a new offense learn a new system and meet some new guys',\n",
       " 'Redskins head coach Jay Grudens roots in calling plays dates back to his days in the AFL Now back in the role of play caller Gruden former colleagues and current players reflect on his success The Nashville Kats were on their way to winning the Arena Football Leagues Eastern Division in the summer of 1997 Jay Gruden a 30yearold rookie offensive coordinator with a head of shaggy brown hair a bright smile and puffy cheeks toiled along their sidelines Nashvilles defensive coordinator Pat Sperduto a longtime friend and former teammate of Grudens walked over to talk before a game In his hand Sperduto clutched his call sheet meticulously organized with plays for different personnel groupings and downs and distances all typed up and laminated Hey wheres your call sheet Sperduto asked Gruden Gruden sunk his hand into one of his pockets and retrieved a crumpled page of yellow legal paper Grinning he presented it to Sperduto What is that Sperduto said Oh just some plays for me to remember Gruden replied A few scribbled notes were all Gruden needed to supplement his gut and an almost photographic memory for football plays He just has it says Sperduto now a scout for the Kansas City Chiefs Whatever it is as far as just a feel and an understanding its pretty impressive It passes through Grudens synapses on Redskins Sundays now When the Redskins kick off their 2017 season on Sunday at FedExField against the Philadelphia Eagles Gruden will again be calling the plays on offense after letting Sean McVay handle those duties the past two years Led by its passing game Washington has had backtoback winning seasons for the first time in two decades and yet it seems the organization could be heading in any direction Last year the defense was among the leagues worst The Redskins missed the playoffs Kirk Cousins future with the franchise remains uncertain If Gruden can keep Washingtons offense near the top of the league for a thirdconsecutive year that it factor might become the most compelling reason for Cousins to stay Grudens life has prepared him well for this task He began cataloging route concepts in his mind as a kid watching Joe Montana run Bill Walshs offense Over more than three decades of playing and coaching in college the Arena League and the NFL he developed quick pattern recognition In hundreds of conversations with his brother Jon in the driveway on the phone and from the press box into Jons earpiece on the Tampa Bay sideline he spitballed ideas for how to break a defense There are traces of all those experiences in Washingtons offense today The origins of a Gruden offense Gruden got to see the West Coast offense revolutionize the NFL in real time In 1977 he watched Montana quarterback Notre Dame to a national championship when his dad Jim was a running backs coach for the Irish In 1982 after Jim moved the family to Tampa for a job with the Buccaneers Jay still had a close tie to Montana through Freddie Solomon the 49ers wide receiver and the primary target on The Catch who spent his offseasons there As a high schooler with NFL ambitions Gruden spent his offseasons working out with Solomon learning the same lessons in fundamentals quarterback play and routerunning that Solomon a former quarterback was getting from Bill Walsh the other seven months of the year It was through their Super Bowl runs Gruden says Freddie Solomon was there Jerry Rice But Joe Montana was the main guy he and Bill Walsh were the guys that I really studied and followed because thats who we wanted to win you know Grudens time in the AFL helped him think creatively about play design and hone his innate ability for calling games but he says the spacing of the field about a third of the size of a regulation field is so different from the outdoor game that the schematics dont transfer over Instead Gruden inherited the core concepts and fundamental beliefs of the Redskins passing game and some of the running game from his brothers coaching tree The Paul Hacketts and Mike Holmgren and obviously Bill Walsh all those guys that Jon learned from and he used I learned from him and were engraved in my head Gruden says Watch the Redskins this season and youll still see a lot of quick passes highpercentage throws and three or fivestep drops Youll see Gruden get his running backs involved in the passing game In an average season his NFL offenses have thrown 83 passes to running backs and gained 518 yards on those plays Theyre going to hit all areas of the field You know were going to get screens nakeds boots all the things that come off the running game said Bengals coach Marvin Lewis the head coach in Cincinnati when Gruden was offensive coordinator there from 201113 Youll also see concepts that Gruden has developed on his own particularly in the deep passing game where hes come up with route combinations that are more Madden than Montana His designs have helped Cousins who led the league with 485 air yards per passing attempt and completed 475 percent of passes that traveled 20 yards or further last season grow from a game manager into an effective deep thrower That is in part a product of the personnel you cant nickel and dime with DeSean Jackson but Gruden has long been a clever architect with the deep ball We had no vertical passing game in Tampa until he got here Jon Gruden says I can remember Jay coming up with some routes you cant just run a straight go route you cant just run a deep cross every time you have to come up with some different types of vertical passes and Jay was really good at helping us do that Jon posits that the AFL did influence his brother schematically in at least one way Receivers cant run out of bounds in the AFL because when Jay played and coached there were only inches of space between the sidelines and the hockeystyle boards enclosing the arena Running straight down the field wasnt a good option Youd run right into the boards and break your neck Jon Gruden says Know what I mean But you can start across the field and then put your foot in the ground and then go back deep where you came from to the opposite pylon When Jon Gruden finally coaxed his brother into coaching with him in Tampa in 2002 Jay used his understanding of spacing and leverage to come up with all sorts of deep angles routes called rage or star routes or code reds He came up with all these crazy vertical double moves that I certainly hadnt thought of Jon Gruden says A long history of calling plays This offseason Gruden has fielded a legion of questions about his return to calling plays His responses have contained traces of confusion and annoyance like hes being asked over and over if hes comfortable breathing His brothers reaction is sharper If Jay Grudens not as good a playcaller as anybody in the league I mean I disagree Jon Gruden says I know what he knows I know what hes done and I know what his role has been in Washington Its not like he just stood there with his foot in his mouth the last two years Come on I mean give me a break Gruden was the Redskins offensive playcaller in 2014 before McVay was given that title and responsibility He called plays in Cincinnati too Finding the start of Grudens playcalling days though requires going back much further Back even before he was on the sideline in Nashville Back to when he was a player Gruden chose Louisville for college in part because of coach Howard Schnellenbergers prostyle offense which asked a lot of him as a young quarterback And when he was with the Tampa Bay Storm coach Lary Kuharich insisted that quarterbacks call their plays I dont know if theres many people out there that have that ability like Jay does where it just came so easy and so natural to him says Sperduto In addition to coaching with Gruden in Nashville Sperduto was one of his linemen in Tampa Bay As teammates they won multiple ArenaBowl championships in the early 1990s It was clear from being in the huddle with Gruden Sperduto says that he knew how to minimize an opponents best pass rusher or motion to get a mismatch and that it all came naturally to him at gamespeed By the time Gruden was calling plays off crumpled sheets of paper in Nashville he was already comfortable as a playcaller He was very aware of everything that was going on in the game and he knew how to attack personnel knew a great deal about the opponents personnel and where the weak spots were says Ed Khayat the former Redskins Eagles and Boston Patriots defensive lineman who hired Gruden as coach of the Kats in 1997 When Jay Gruden joined his brothers Buccaneers as an offensive assistant in 2002 he got a chance to use that awareness in the NFL game Jon and Jay Gruden were connected by their headsets Jon on the sideline and Jay watching from the press box for seven years Even in his first year with the team Jay Gruden didnt hesitate to speak up during a critical situation Jon Gruden remembers one play during Super Bowl XXXVII which the Buccaneers won 4821 against the Oakland Raiders where Jays it factor was on display The Bucs were already up 10 points before halftime and facing a firstandgoal from the Raiders 5yard line Jay Grudens voice shot into Jons earpiece Hey Get to 374 Wasp Jon Gruden called it Bucs wide receiver Keenan McCardell split out wide to the right and ran a fly route right at Raiders cornerback Charles Woodson then stopped Quarterback Brad Johnson made the throw and McCardell caught it over his back shoulder for a touchdown It stung them pretty good Jon says The task this year Right now the Redskins future is murky The offseason was defined by changes made to the defense which must improve for the team to have success But if Washington remains in the playoff picture and posts a thirdconsecutive winning season itll likely be for the same reason as last two they scored points Should those things happen the comfort of an offense thats helped him pass for 4000 yards in backtoback seasons and a coach who has backed him and helped him succeed may be the Redskins best chance to convince Cousins to stay Its not fair to put that all on Gruden but whats fair is not always whats relevant at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va Its also not accurate to say that Washington needs only to recreate its offensive output of the last two seasons to have success Weve got to figure out a way to be balanced Gruden says Not just at the beginning of the year but at the end of the year I think sometimes when you have so many weapons everybodys like Man Jordan Jamison Josh Terrelle Just throw the ball every snap But I think our offense is best when we can run the ball be physical Historically Gruden hasnt been as passhappy as his reputation indicates Only twice in the last six seasons has a Gruden offense ranked in the top half of the league by passing play percentage One of those seasons was 2016 in Washington however when the Redskins threw more often than all but seven other teams That imbalance put up numbers but it also led to problems most acutely in the red zone The Redskins were 30th in the league in touchdown percentage inside the 20yard line where Cousins completion percentage dropped from 67 to 4578 I think Jays one of those guys thats going to go off feel says starting running back Rob Kelley If he feels like were killing in the run game hes going to run it If he feels like were picking up in the pass game hes going to pass it Hes one of those guys where youve got to show him that you can stop it The Redskins will try to rededicate themselves to the ground game If that succeeds they hope it will help their play action game as well a strength of Cousins Beyond those things the Redskins offense wont look terribly different this year to the average viewer Its always been Jays offense at the end of the day Cousins says So even though Sean was involved in the past the fact that Jay is the one calling it now theres not a lot of change because it was always Jays system And he was very involved in the gameplanning and even in the gameday play calling decisions And yes they will still throw the fade I only called it like six times all year for Gods sakes Gruden says Its just they were 0for6 Selfdeprecation aside hes serious Just watch Cincinnati tape Gruden says The reason Im sitting here today is because we threw the fade He loves the fade confirms AJ Green A constant competitor Gruden still uses the word quit to describe his decision to go into coaching Back then in 1997 his goal of playing quarterback in the NFL still felt within his reach He had a young family to support though and wanted to give them security Had he gotten hurt playing hed have lost his source of income Khayat offered him a 57000 guaranteed salary as offensive coordinator in Nashville Gruden took it Gruden is glad he made the choice to give his wife Sherry and their three boys stability He was around to coach his sons basketball teams and go to their school events Still stepping off the field was hard I loved playing so much Gruden says It was hard to walk away because it didnt make sense

called a Jeopardy answer first At the NFL Combine this March Gruden sought him out in the stands of Lucas Oil Stadium and told him to download Words With Friends so I can whoop your ass Competitive banter has always been a hallmark of Grudens personality Hes the same person he was in his 20s playing for the Storm teasing Sperduto and his other linemen after they let him take a hit You honestly

Italian Ive got that Italian mother guilt complex he plays on that big time Like Dont worry I dont need my back Youd feel so guilty Sperduto recalls As a coach Gruden still motivates with that biting sense of humor When Gruden came to Washington in 2014 some players mistook his easy demeanor for a lack of discipline or intensity Now entering his fourth season his contract extended through 2020 Gruden has grown comfortable being in control Im comfortable with people around me Gruden says We have a great staff and Ive gotten to know the players My first year here I didnt know anybody playerwise Nobody And theyre set in their ways and Well we didnt do it like this last year But I think everybodys gotten to know me a little bit more and I think everybodys more comfortable being around each other Now the Redskins often describe Gruden as a players coach Most in the locker room feel a sense of loyalty to him They say he hasnt forgotten what its like to be in their shoes When they dont succeed I take it hard Gruden says I feel like I let them down There are complications to having it Expectations for the talented can lead to extreme personal demands Did he do enough Did he do it right Even though he was the one to call for 374 Wasp Gruden keeps his Super Bowl XXXVII ring locked away at home because he doesnt think his contribution earned it Dozens of people and thousands of hours have helped Gruden get to where he is now His innate ability along with a few disorganized notes began his run from coaching for stability to chasing a Super Bowl ring he can call his own He has formulated one of the leagues top offenses as the primary mode to get there creating both a benefit and complication with his starting quarterback The upbeat presence of a rookie

Despite his recent success against the Eagles Cousins enters Sundays game with a little less certainty with his weapons Unlike last season where he return proven players in DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon Cousins top two receiving targets could be Terrelle Pryor Sr and Josh Doctson Pryor is coming off a 1000yard season with the Cleveland Browns but is still relatively new to the positon He was brilliant during training camp wowing fans with acrobatic catch after acrobatic catch But he showed room for improvement during the preseason struggling to retain some of his targets Doctson meanwhile oozes talent but could not stay healthy his rookie season as he appeared in just two games Even though the 2015 unanimous AllAmerican is still somewhat of a mystery Cousins thinks his natural abilities could make up for lost time on the field We just do need him out there for him to be able to show what he can do and really make a difference for our team and for our offense Cousins said Im excited for that just like Im sure the fan base is to see what hes got in the tank Weve had a good week of practice here Weve just got to continue to give him opportunities Cousins understands that the task ahead wont be easy even if Doctson is at full health making players Last season the Pro Bowler threw two pick sixes against Philadelphia They do have a good scheme Cousins said Then when you think about the fact that its now their second year in this scheme that gives their team ability to get the personnel catered to what they want and to have more experience Its going to be a really

ExemptLeft Squad list head coach Jay Gruden called upon the next man up Deshazor Everett to take his place Everett fought his way onto Washingtons active roster after transitioning from cornerback to safety His best game at safety came during the Redskins victory over the Eagles last December as he recorded his first career interception on a throw into the end zone by Carson Wentz I think he will do a good job Gruden said Its just a matter of lining up correctly getting the calls communicating with DJ Swearinger and making plays I know the one thing he can do he can tackle He is not afraid Everett will be tasked with corralling Philadelphias much improved receiving corps led by new addition Alshon Jeffery Everett will have help from cornerback Josh Norman when guarding Jeffery but when it comes to deep jumpballs Jefferys specialty the tall receiver has the height advantage Theyve got some guys that can go deep on you Everett said Theyve got some big body guys Jeffery Theyve got a guy in the slot that can do everything a gadget guy Theyve got Sproles who can line up at tailback and could split out and catch passes on screens First down second down goal line they just do it all Brandon Hill REPEAT LAST YEARS GROUND GAME PRODUCTION VS PHILLY While the Redskins were inconsistent running the ball last season two of Washingtons best ground performances came against Philadelphia In a Week 6 2720 victory Washingtons tailbacks combined for 230 rushing yards Then in December Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson each scored touchdowns as the duo combined for more than 100 yards on just 19 carries Gruden said this week that the offense despite so many weapons out wide is at its worst when theyre not multidimensional Center Spencer Long echoed the coachs sentiment saying it will take a unit effort to make sure Washingtons ground game anchors a well balanced attack Its just being consistent all 11 guys and clicking on all cylinders and that means backtiming on the offensive line not missing blocks the edges holding up the tight ends knowing their assignments Long said It just takes everybody so to have an efficient run game in this league everyones got to be on and a hat and on their assignments Thats what weve got to do Washingtons rushing attack could be a threeheaded effort with Kelley and Thompson this year joined by rookie Samaje Perine a powerful runner who set Oklahomas career rushing record last year But the group will be led by Kelley once again Washingtons starter for the final nine games last year Settled into his role this year after clawing for time at the beginning of last season Gruden expects a jump in Kelleys production He knows protections running lanes the steps the footwork and all that stuff Gruden said Hes a lot more comfortable or more natural where now he can get the ball in his hands and do his thing Been impressed with how hes progressed from his rookie year to now Stephen Czarda DONT LET THE BALL FLY OFF WENTZ HAND Redskins fans and players alike experienced the true potential of quarterback Carson Wentz in the most recent matchup between these division rivals In the teams most recent meeting the thenrookie impressed completing 32 of his 46 passes for 314 yards and a touchdown Wentz had the Redskins defense on the ropes late in the fourth quarter as well until Ryan Kerrigan s gamesealing strip sack with under a minute to go removed all doubt Wentzs performance that day represented one of the few bright spots in what was a tough second half of the season for him He claimed the spotlight early on in the season putting up passer ratings of 1010 866 1259 and 1028 in his first four games as a pro but those numbers soon began to fade His average passer rating dipped to 721 in the last nine games of the season Despite his inconsistency Wentz showed flashes of a franchise quarterback in his rookie season Hes a good quarterback he definitely is Everett said He can throw the ball well He has mobility You cant just give him a title of Hes a pocket passer or Hes a runner because hell run to create or hell sit in the pocket until hes hit and delivers a throw Thats maturity of the quarterback The 24yearold enters his second season in the league with somewhat of a new supporting cast Jeffery looks to be replacing Jordan Matthews in the top wide receiver spot after signing with the team this offseason while fellow newcomer Torrey Smith is projected to start alongside him at wideout Additionally LeGarrette Blount will anchor the backfield after his standout season in New England The Redskins need to a find a way to frustrate him so that he cant get into a tempo with a rebuilt offense We have to try to get them some thirdandlongs and put our hand in the dirt and let Ryan Kerrigan and Junior

So you dont really have time to get bored You get back to your room at 9301030 then youve got to be right back to the facility All the free time you get is probably used to recover and rest Youve talked about your vegan diet are you still keeping that up Laughing Plead the fifth No I had to make some changes Ive still got some of the same vegan qualities So youre still health conscious Yeah it was a trial run for me What was the biggest takeaway from that experience Just how good it feels for your body when you put the right things into it What was your general reaction to the Charlottesville news near the end of camp It was a sad situation Issues boiled over unfortunately people lost their lives and people got hurtIts America youve got people protesting anything and everything these days You never want to see anybody lose their life behind it Do you follow the news a lot I dont have time Not yet anyways I guess when I start getting some more free time probably But I watch ESPN and NFL Network Do you feel like you need to watch it with so many events happening every day With social media now its basically like a news outlet so you get all the headlines without even having to turn on the TV You say watch the news no I dont watch CNN but its pretty easy to keep up with events that are happening You use Twitter but you dont tweet a lot No Why is that Twitter can be a positive outlet and it can be a place where a lot of people lose their cool Once you put it out there you cant get it back Im not saying thats the reason I dont use it but I put a lot into it Have you just seen those issues happen to others Yeah I just learned from other people Do you feel like youre an optimist about society I try to be Being a pessimist doesnt really do you any justice in trying to move forward in life and trying to make things better I try to take an optimistic approach Its not always the case but as much as possible When you went through your suspension last year did it challenge that mindset Yeah it was challenging In what way It was something I had to go through that I didnt necessarily felt like it should have happened You try to stay positive through that How did you stay positive Just standing around the team standing around the guys They did a good job and they helped me out a lot When your leadership was questioned by the outside did you feel like that was fair Thats life The thing about it is as long as the guys in the locker room werent questioning it its really all that matters Thats who you set out to lead thats who you set out to influence Everybody on the outside can question all they want but it really has no bearing on me until you step between these doors Did you feel like you were always someone who could lead a group of men No I didnt A lot of people say naturalborn leader I probably wouldnt be in that category If you think about it the characteristics of a naturalborn leader I just havent always been that talker a guy that likes to be the center of attention In that sense no In the sense of me being able to relate to people and me being able to uplift guys and try to help people stay positive I think in that way When did you feel like that started Coach Mike Shanahan did a lot for me when I first got into the NFL Guys really dont follow words they follow actions Thats why you tend to see more often than not the captains of the team usually have the play to back it up With the NFL being such a revolving door people who do tend to stick around are the people who put out a relatively good product on the field I think that has a direct correlation to leadership Thats only half the battle Being able to relate to your teammates being able to gain their trust As an offensive lineman do you think of yourself as a protector Is that the mentality you have Protector I guess you could say that I feel like were more of a specialops unit like infantry We all work as a group and our success the teams success the offenses success it directly correlates to how we do how well we play together Do you know a lot about specialops units No Watching movies Specialops SWAT team Seal Team 6 you call in a group of guys to come get a job done nobody does it singlehandedly I feel like that more so how we come in we come in as a group with a lot of camaraderie really cohesive and our success really hinges on that being able to play together and understand each other and to have that bond I have to say Im still amazed at your Silverback gorilla back tattoo Laughing Whats the origin of that nickname It just came at school man At Oklahoma Yeah So how did that come about Its a lot of ways the attitude kind of for the most part laid back just real chill and when the time is needed switch the flip on Do whats needed How long did it take to get that tattoo 12 hours It was broken up into two sessions seven and five What do you do for all that time Shoot there aint much you can do It sucks Whats the best piece of advice youve ever received I think a piece of advice I tell myself every day is control what you can control And what you cant control dont let it worry you A lot of people worry themselves with things thats so far out of their control you cant really do nothing about it Is there an example of how that manifests for you Just everyday life You ask me about watching the news a lot of people sit and watch the news and get terrified of whats going on in the world and what decision are being made You cant control any of that Kind of like the flooding in Houston Right Mother Nature nobody can control Thats different lifethreatening stuff I noticed the other day at practice offensive line coach Bill Callahan took you guys onto the side field so you couldnt listen to music during drills Laughing Yeah Is that the worst part of his drills Yeah hes the reason the music really wasnt playing in the beginning of practice Because you like playing DJ right I aint gonna say I like playing DJ but music really does help get through the monotony of practice and helps keep the juices flowing so having the music around does help But Coach Callahan does a lot of talking and teaching He hates having to talk over the music so thats why hes against it So you just have to negotiate The only thing thats being negotiated is if he dont want it he dont want it As you prepare for the season opener against the Eagles is it clich for you to say youre ready Is there any apprehension or extreme confidence in yourself as you approach the start I dont think apprehension would be the right word Youre kind of a little nervous just because its the first game of the year These blows really count You dont want to take a loss I mean theres a lot of stuff going into it Youre not certain You know how you want the season to go and no ones certain how high it will go You dont know man theres a lot of uncertainty theres a lot of optimism theres a lot of nervous energy I feel like this is the longest part of the year if you include the four preseason games and you have a few more days all the way until this game How do you get through that to stay sharp There aint really much you can do thats why it seems so long Is the experience of walking through the tunnel still a thrill for you Its always a thrill anytime you go through that tunnel The season opener everybody is so amped up for it youve got literally months and months to look forward to what games have got to be played on the schedule Open up with a divisional opponent who weve had some battles with always adds a little more to the opening night factor',\n",

       " 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was a eightplay 69yard drive capped by running back Chris Thompson bludgeoning and eluding three defenders en route to the end zone After an interception return for touchdown by linebacker Ryan Kerrigan and ensuing defensive stop the Redskins offense continued the momentum near the end of the second quarter in their 3017 loss to the Eagles Sunday afternoon At the time trailing by six points quarterback Kirk Cousins and the offense put together their first real sustained drive of the game marching 69 yards from their own 31yard line thanks in large part to a titanic effort from running back Chris Thompson On the eighth play of the drive Thompson ran outside and then streaked up the right hash where Cousins hit him with a pass in stride Waiting for him in the middle of the field were three Eagles defenders all of whom were tossed aside as Thompson took a couple big hits spun and eluded the grasp of their depleted efforts He then sprinted the extra 15 yards into the end zone tying the game with less than two minutes before the half I really cant break down what happened what I was thinking Thompson said It was just something that happened on that play I was just looking to make a big play As an offense we werent prepared for them at the level that I thought we were capable of For me I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play The drive began with an incompletion to running back Rob Kelley but he took the next handoff for four yards On third down Cousins found wide receiver Ryan Grant for 10 yards to move the chains sparking the rest of the drive Cousins completed a pass to tight end Jordan Reed for five yards then connected with Thompson for a fiveyard pass that narrowly gained the yardage necessary for a first down Thompson a heavy contributor on this drive took the next handoff for a fouryard rush before collecting the touchdown pass that would ultimately give the Redskins the lead with a Dustin Hopkins field goal Thats my job said Thompson who signed a contract extension earlier in the week Ive got to make plays with the amount of snaps that I get Ive got to come in Ive got to make plays right away It got us up but by halftime we were down again For me Ive got to come in in the second half and just make more plays',\n",
       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 1 game against the Philadelphia Eagles that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 With time to take over the game with less than two minutes left Washingtons last effort ended with a fumble returned for touchdown After the defense held stout on a sixplay 33yard drive that resulted in Philadelphia only extending their lead to five points Washington had time to go into their twominute offense and strike for a gamewinning score But on the second play of a drive that started with 159 left on the game clock Kirk Cousins was strip sacked before Fletcher Cox scoped up the ball and returned it for a 20yard touchdown The play went under review as Cousins thought the he didnt fumble but the referees upheld the call on the field There are so many times where I am decisively saying Oh its worked out this way Then I go back and look at it and say Im completely wrong In the moment what do I know Im just playing Cousins said But right away I looked back the ref and went like this motioning arm forward and my arms going forward But they have time to take a look at it and get it right They made the call they made So Im not going to lose sleep over that Its the plays that led up to the moment and those are the ones that I want back That fumble was part of a difficult afternoon for the offensive unit as they finished the day 0for2 in the red zone threefor10 on third downs and had four turnovers Its frustrating Gruden said I think were better than that up front Were better than that at receiver dropping balls and were better than that at quarterback We all had our hand in it playcallers offensively it wasnt good enough obviously We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us Stephen Czarda 2 Ryan Kerrigan helped swing some momentum in the Redskins favor during the second quarter with the third picksix of his career Scoring the teams first points of the game in the second quarter Kerrigan caught Carson Wentzs pass intended for running back Darren Sproles and ran it into the end zone for a 24yard touchdown Well I got an assist from Stacy McGee there made it a little easier on me to make the catch Kerrigan said But I just had my coverage responsibility expanded with him and fortunately found the ball in my hands The picksix marks the linebackers third career interception all of which have been returned for touchdowns Kerrigan also contributed to one of the teams two sacks of Wentz who posed a challenge for the Redskins defense Clearly hes a tough guy to get down Kerrigan said I mean hes big hes athletic and we had a couple chances today where we had him wrapped up and he was able to escape like on the very first drive of the game when he launched that ball to Nelson Agholar and they scored a touchdown so I think you just got to wrap him up you got to wrap and hold on and wait for the posse to come Despite the teams overall challenges Kerrigan believes that the Washingtons defense forged a fair effort against Wentz and the Eagles offense I think by and large we played pretty well defensively a couple turnovers and we scored Alyssa Haduck 3 The defense showed glimpses of a more aggressive approach under Greg Manusky but were frustrated by the inability to bottle up Carson Wentz Throughout the offseason the defense remained open about its desire to be in more of an attacking mode under Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator after a year as the teams outside linebackers coach That was on display early as Josh Norman nearly had a diving interception on the units first play of the game before Preston Smith recorded a sack one snap later Then on third down it looked like the Redskins were going to get another sack from Jonathan Allen but Wentz slipped out of the rookies tackle attempt before extending the play just long enough to toss up a 50yard touchdown bomb It was one of a handful of plays in which the Redskins payed for not taking down the secondyear quarterback He made some good plays out there and really helped his team in tight spots said linebacker Mason Foster Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays We were right there We will go look at it and get it corrected and just keep getting better and try to make this the last one like that Wentz finished the day completing 26of39 passes for 307 yards with two touchdowns to one interception If you dont take him down when you get your hands on him he is going to make plays down the field said cornerback Bashaud Breeland He keeps his eyes down the field Stephen Czarda 4 In a backandforth contest the Redskins struggled to maintain possession of the ball and it cost them An aggressive Eagles defense made it difficult for the Redskins offense to produce on their possessions Early in the fourth quarter an interception at the goal line on third down robbed the Redskins of a chance to score in a game in which they were only trailing 1917 On a third down throw inside the 15yard line Cousins soared a pass over the head of Jamison Crowder The Eagles would intercept the ball and end any chance of the Redskins taking back the lead at that point I mean its anytime youre in the red zone and its third down youre going to expect some kind of allout zerocover blitz and thats what they gave us and we didnt handle it very well Gruden said But anytime youre down there youre going to protect the football Youve got to be safe with the ball That was a good rush but I think the ball just sailed on him by a hair unfortunately With less than two minutes left in the game Cousins was sacked and lost control of the ball Officials ruled the play a fumble allowing Eagles defensive tackle Fletcher Cox to recover the ball and carry it into the end zone We still had a chance to win there in the twominute Gruden said Defense kept us in the game but unfortunately a turnover for a touchdown cost us The Redskins will take note of the weaknesses in Sundays performance and look to adjust and improve for this weeks road game against the Los Angeles Rams Alyssa Haduck 5 The Redskins understand that they wont get the results they want on offense if theyre not balanced Prior to Sundays game Gruden noted in one of his press conferences last week that the offense will only be at its best when theyre balancing the number of passing and running plays But against the Eagles nearly 60 percent of Washingtons offensive plays were throws by Cousins Rob Kelley and Chris Thompson combined for just 13 caries while Cousins extended four passing plays into scrambles out of the pocket as the quarterback finished the day with four carries for 30 yards In total the Redskins managed just 60 rushing yards on 17 carries Our offense is always going to hum along at a much more efficient rate when were running the ball well and we can keep the defenses unaware if its going to be a run pass or a play action Cousins said If you can honor the run then you can hopefully open up some windows in the pass game I wouldve loved to run the ball better but theres also situations in the game too that you feel like youre throwing it well or youre getting third and long and not able to run it But if youre thirdandone youre going to get a lot more rushing attempts So sometimes its just situations that determine the play calling You get less attempts in practice with being able to run the ball Kelley said the entire offensive unit needs to execute better when they plan on running the ball Ten guys do something right and one guy does something wrong it messes up the play Kelley said Its just us being a team clinging on to each other knowing that we have each others back working together and executing Stephen Czarda',\n",

       " 'Sean McVays rise to become the youngest head coach in NFL history wouldnt have been possible without the Redskins or Jay Gruden Now Washington will face McVay in only his second game as Los Angeles head coach Kirk Cousins couldnt exactly believe at first that Sean McVay was one of the Washington Redskins coaches during his first few days in the NFL When Cousins was selected in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL Draft the former Michigan State product was just months away from his 24 th birthday McVay meanwhile was a 26yearold entering his second season as the Redskins tight ends coach But the two were sharing a football field at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun County Va that spring as one was trying to pick up an NFL offense for the first time while the other was beginning an ascent up the professional coaching ranks I thought that was just unique because where I had come from at Michigan State which is all I had known at the time we didnt have coaches that were that young position coaches Cousins said We had Matt LaFleur we had Kyle Shanahan all those coaches were young at that time but they were all sharp You could see right away Sean as he coached the tight ends not only was he sharp but he knew his material inside and out There was a conviction when he taught it that what this guy is saying not only is correct but its going to help me become a better player Regardless of his age I think guys listen to him right away and people who were older than him were willing to be coached by him because they respected his knowledge for the game and his desire for them to succeed Despite being younger than some of the players he was coaching McVay clearly had a coaching pedigree that was bound for success In his first season as Washingtons tight ends coach in 2011 McVay guided former secondround pick Fred Davis to the best season of his career as he posted career highs in receptions 59 and receiving yards 796 Two years later McVay was tasked with getting the most out of a thenrookie by the name of Jordan Reed In just nine games Reed recorded 45 receptions for 499 yards and three touchdowns both franchise records by a rookie tight end In a victory over the Chicago Bears Reed also recorded Redskins rookie tight end records in singlegame receptions nine and receiving yards 134 The record was previously held by Jerry Smith who registered just 78 receiving yards on six catches vs Dallas on Nov 28 1965 After the Redskins hired Jay Gruden to be 29 th head coach in franchise history on Jan 9 2014 McVay was appointed the teams offensive coordinator at the ripe age of 28 The two have longterm ties far before their time together roaming the sidelines for the Redskins Grudens father Jim was a scout for the San Francisco 49ers when McVays grandfather John was the teams general manager Jim Gruden also coached McVays father Tim while he was a player at Indiana The bond between the two families continued in Tampa first in 2008 with the Buccaneers and then again one season later with the Florida Tuskers of the United Football League So even though McVay was young Gruden felt comfortable handing over some of the offensive duties to him When I first got the job in Washington I didnt want to just totally change the entire system Gruden said Some of the terminology in place here in the running game and some of the playaction passes and keepers and all that stuff So the dropback game we tried to implement from what Ive known from over the past with my brother and in Cincinnati and Sean has a great idea of that also because he was with us in Tampa Bay for a year and he was also with me in the UFL for one year So I felt like just from talking to the quarterbacks instead of me having to tell him what the call to the quarterback and so forth it was quicker to let him do it We came up with the game plans together and situational type football we came up together and then I still had a little bit of input but I let him handle it because he was good and did a fine job McVay of course served as Washingtons offensive coordinator for three seasons 201416 Last year Washingtons offense became the first unit in franchise history to average more than 400 yards per game 4034 and notched a franchise record 6545 total net yards They also had three Pro Bowlers on offense as Trent Williams earned his fifthconsecutive nod while Cousins and guard Brandon Scherff received their first selections The Redskins also had eight players finish the season with at least 500 yards from scrimmage DeSean Jackson Pierre Garcon Jamison Crowder Rob Kelley Chris Thompson Jordan Reed Vernon Davis and Matt Jones tying the 2011 New Orleans Saints for the most in a single season in NFL history In early January McVay interviewed with both the Rams and San Francisco 49ers While most though McVay was just getting his feet wet in being a head coach candidate Los Angeles thought otherwise On Jan 12 2017 McVay became the youngest coach in modern NFL history when the Rams named him the 23 rd fulltime head coach in their franchise history I wasnt shocked said Williams who was drafted by the Redskins the same year McVay joined the coaching staff I mean you sit down and talk to him and hes knows football inside and out So its not a position its not a scheme that he doesnt know I mean he can sit up there in the box or on the sideline and basically tell you whats happening whats going to happen and why it happened And in this game many times somebody that has that type of knowledge of the game theyre going to be highly sought after His impact on Washingtons offense was undeniable Cousins even signed a jersey for McVay and left a heartfelt message about his impact It just said and theres a lot of people I could say this to but certainly to him I just said I owe you my career and then signed it Cousins said I certainly appreciate the hard work he gave to our team and as a result gave me an opportunity to be successful and it was just a smart hire by Jay to bring him in in the first place at his age Very smart by Jay to give him the role that he gave him and the opportunities he gave him and you know thats one of Jays strengths his ability to identify potential in people and believe in them maybe when its not the common thought everywhere else Its not an obvious choice Jay clearly made a really good decision there in bringing in Sean and Sean proved him right and as a result hes a head coach now So I guess when you make good decisions like that and have success you could lose those people but Seans certainly a great coach To this day even though McVay is now more than 2500 miles from the Washington DC area he remains a fan of the Redskins outside of any time Washington and Los Angeles face off Gruden and McVay remain in touch on a frequent basis including after their games last Sunday but both have assured they arent giving away any sort of competitive advantage Nobodys a bigger Redskins fan every other week than I am just because what some of those people in that organization have done for me and how theyve treated me McVay said Cant say enough about Jay Gruden and just really the mentor hes been for me This week marks the first time Gruden and McVay will face off as opposing head coaches after the latter made a successful debut last Sunday The Rams easily defeated the Indianapolis Colts 469 in a historic day for Los Angeles Despite Grudens familiarity with McVay Washingtons head coach knows schematically his counterpart will find ways to keep the Redskins on their toes Gruden said hes been spending a little bit more time with his defensive staff this week in preparation for McVays offense Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations a lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of stacks and theyve got a good running game with Todd Gurley and he changes it up with good playaction passes Gruden said I can tell them what he likes but stopping it is another issue because you stop certain things but then they hit you with the running game or they hit you with the playpass or hit you with the bunchstack deal and the quick game and its a great changeup We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel Cousins added It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly In this league that tends to happen weektoweek or yeartoyear as people change and move Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Washingtons defense will face the 2016 No 1overall pick in Jared Goff along with weapons like Gurley and wide receiver Sammy Watkins who was one of four Rams receivers to record at least 50 receiving yards last week Weve got to have our heads on a swivel and play our assignments and our keys said cornerback Josh Norman Understand what they like they to do against us because offense was here and now its there Jay runs similar things and weve just got to understand that and know what they like to do and try to take that away from them Because what you see is what youre going to get Mike linebacker Mason Foster knows that the unit must be at its best or McVays offensive genius will strike early and often He can find different ways to get the matchups that he likes and thats what he did here Foster said Even when I first got here and I was playing on the scout team When I first got picked up he was always asking me about different defenses Ive played in Hes a great coach and you see why he got that job At the end of the day its the Washington Redskins vs the LA Rams and its going to be a good one Its going to be cool to see Sean it was great to see somebody that came from here doing big things but at the end of the day were going down there to get a W and thats it',\n",
       " 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Executing plays will overcome the familiarity that head coach Sean McVay has with the Redskins offense Eight months ago Rams head coach Sean McVay was still the Redskins offensive coordinator which is to say that hes still quite familiar with the kind of offense that Washington will be using when the team visits Los Angeles this weekend For quarterback Kirk Cousins that can have its drawbacks but it ultimately wont matter too much so long as the Redskins execute like they know they can on Sunday I think Sean McVay would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Although Cousins wasnt happy with his play on Sunday theres likely nothing McVay could have told him differently that head coach Jay Gruden and offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh havent already discussed Its all correctable Cousins said Its all there to be fixed and its disappointing that we let one get away at home but theres nothing we can do to change it now We can only move forward and try to make the most of each opportunity we have and in preparing for the next opportunity Weve got a great challenge coming on Sunday and we can get right back where we want to be with a great performance and a win so thats where our focus is 2 McVay has meant a lot to Cousinss career and has always believed in him Before McVay left for the Rams Cousins signed a jersey for him and wrote I owe you my career on it Cousins said Wednesday there are a number of people to whom he could write that message but that McVay has never wavered in his trust of him Cousins an avid reader is currently reading Bill Walshs book and cited a passage about the former football coach who says the four most powerful words from a coach to a player are I believe in you Its the same kind of approach McVay took with Cousins working with him through the high and low parts of his career Sean said that to me over and over and over again even when there werent many other people who did so that certainly means a lot Cousins said Especially when you look back and see where we came from there Cousins elaborated on why he feels so strongly about McVay and the impact on him over the last several years Well I mean he was our play caller for my two best seasons in the league he said Im not telling you anything you dont already know I think its pretty selfevident why hes had a big impact on my careerSean has presence and its hard to teach presence He has charisma Thats hard to teach and its hard to teach being a good communicator You kind of either have it or you dont So you can talk about his age but he had presence when he was 20 years old and theres a lot of guys who are 65 who dont have any presence 3 The reads Cousins makes based on the defense are more important than the personnel around him Much was made about the amount of snaps certain offensive players received Sunday against the Eagles and how the ball was to be distributed to them This is not particularly a concern for Cousins who makes decisions about throwing the football based primarily on the defensive looks hes receiving on each play as he comes under center When they draw up the game plan they can create formations and motions and reads where certain guys may have a higher percentage chance of getting the football Cousins said But once it comes to game day unless its a complete 5050 read Im just going off what the coverage dictates and the front and what the read tells me to do and then from there what the postsnap read tells me to do It can be everybody on any given day and from week to week I think it will change quite a bit 4 Aaron Donalds return means it will be another tough task for the offensive line The Rams defensive line is considered one of the best in the NFL and it will receive a credible boost when Aaron Donald returns to the team this week after sitting out the preseason over a contract dispute Cousins hasnt studied the interior lineman too much but knows exactly the kind of presence and push he brings to the Rams defense I think that he seems to have really good leverage Cousins said He seems to be a very compact player He seems to have really good getoff off the snap count Hes quicktwitch Hes sudden He uses leverage and power Football is a game of leverage and power and he knows how to use it and get every ounce of his power and drive where he needs it to create havoc in the backfield The Redskins offensive line struggled with the Eagles pass rush allowing four sacks and several hurries forcing Cousins into quicker throws and a cluttered pocket in which to work The line will have to take step up to neutralize a pass rush that created four sacks one hit and five hurries against the Colts I do feel that every week when you look at the NFL schedule you can name a player on the other side of the ball whos dominant whos a game changing player and Aarons no different Cousins said They have a couple others as well But thats the NFL and thats why this league is so tough and also so great is because theres just such a challenge every single week 5 Timing between himself and receivers is always a work in progress Cousins explained on Wednesday that timing isnt like checking a box It requires constant tuning especially when going up against dangerous pass rushes each week As he works with his receivers to gain more trust with them the timing between them will begin to tighten up You have to kind of see it before it happens and then trust it and let it go and believe that its going to happen the way it needs to once the ball is out of your hands Cousins said That takes time and work and thats why Ive said for a long time were a work in progress Specifically looking at last Sunday Cousins is encouraged because most of the mistakes that were made were correctible in his eyes If they werent then youd be sitting here pretty nervous Cousins said But I do feel like including myself that a lot of the stuff that we didnt do well enough can be fixed and corrected and need to be So weve just got to get back out keep working never lose confidence and just prepare for the next one',\n",

       " 'While the Redskins applied consistent pressure on the Eagles last Sunday they couldnt wrap up quarterback Carson Wentz They realize they need better execution against the Rams Despite holding the Eagles offense to just 58 rushing yards returning an interception for a touchdown and producing a consistent pass rush the Redskins defense struggled to execute when it mattered most last Sunday That was mostly a reflection of quarterback Carson Wentz who extended plays with his feet and strength refusing to fall down after numerous Redskins defensive players had their chances to tug and wrap him to the ground The scrambling led to chaos in the secondary and Eagles wide receivers managed to break free for bigger gains the majority of which felt even more backbreaking because they occurred on third down The most costly happened on the first drive of the game with the Eagles facing a long third down when Wentz spun away from three defenders and found wide receiver Nelson Agholor wide open breaking a DJ Swearinger tackle and running into the end zone It stung even more considering cornerback Josh Norman had dropped an interception falling backwards in the end zone on the first defensive play of the game plastering wide receiver Torrey Smith on a deep route I dont know I think the plays are there Norman said We just need to make them Have the quarterback wrapped up we got to bring him down We got to have our hands on the ball We got to bring that down as well Just little things My errors my keys that I can be better in The third down struggles continued with the Eagles converting 8of14 of them six of which coming on thirdandlong It was the glaring issue in what was otherwise a solid debut for defensive coordinator Greg Manusky whose unit faced a lot of short fields thanks to four turnovers on the day The inability to get off the field on third downs was something that plagued the team last year they finished last in that category allowing for conversions 466 percent of the time For reference Tampa Bays defense was the best at getting off the field last season holding opponents to a 343 percent conversion rate Rushing the passer Got to rush the passer head coach Jay Gruden said of finding more success on third down You can play different coverages theres going to be a hole in a zone if you play zone mantoman youre going to have to buckle down and play good tight mantoman At the end of the day youve got to rush the passer You cant give the quarterback time to throw and set his feet that easily like we did Its easy for pro quarterbacks to pick you apart and find an open receiver if they have time It wasnt as though the defense didnt get pressure on Wentz Linebacker Preston Smith recorded a sack early in the game and Kerrigan and defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis teamed up for another later But many other instances the Redskins left sacks on the field He was playing backyard football scrambling around making plays with his feet defensive lineman Ziggy Hood said of Wentz Give credit to him wheres hes due Like I said it was just a tugofwar match and we lost on a couple of them A lot of their plays came from broken plays from being outside the pocket and us missing the sacks linebacker Zach Brown said If we get those sacks its totally different we just got to make sure next time we go against them our goal we think about is We got to make sure we get the quarterback to the ground That would eliminate at least three or four third down conversions and its a totally different game Both Brown and Hood said their position groups take the responsibility for the breakdowns in coverage noting that receivers will usually have an easy opportunity to get open when a quarterback is given eight seconds to roam around in the backfield Norman would agree but also realized that the defensive backs were in position to make a couple of interceptions on Sunday too As the Redskins prepare to take on the Rams and limit quarterback Jared Goff they can feel confident in the talent they have on the field and the game plan to stop Los Angeles They just want to make it all count You put all that work into getting into that point of attack and then youre there but you just got to finish the play Norman said Thats the easy part Just finishing I think the hardest part is getting to that Once you can you just got to capitalize and be great',\n",

3of11 27 percent on third downs while the defense allowed the Eagles to convert on more than half of their tries 8of14 Washingtons defensive unit actually was stout in short distances on third downs as they held Philadelphia to just 2of4 on third down attempts with five yards or less needed to move the chains But the Redskins allowed the Eagles to convert on half of their attempts of 3 rd and8 or greater yardage On the Eagles first third down of the game it looked like the Redskins were going to force a threeandout But two near sacks werent enough to take down Carson Wentz who launched a 58yard touchdown bomb on 3 rd and12 To stop such plays the Redskins need to get home and finish their plays especially with the quarterback in their grasp Rushing the passer Got to rush the passer said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden You can play different coverages theres going to be a hole in a zone if you play zone mantoman youre going to have to buckle down and play good tight mantoman At the end of the day youve got to rush the passer You cant give the quarterback time to throw and set his feet that easily like we did Its easy for pro quarterbacks to pick you apart and find an open receiver if they have time Offensively the Redskins cant make the same mistakes they did last week on third downs if they want to score their first victory of the season The unit was 0of2 inside the red zone and a critical third down interception by Kirk Cousins took points off the board We have to do a lot of things better Gruden said We have to protect better We have to throw the ball better We have to run better routes So it is just a combination of things I have got to call better plays I have to call plays that are conducive to those situations and the coverages that we are going to see by percentage and then we have to protect So a little bit of everything Stephen Czarda BE ON YOUR TOES AGAINST AN OLD FOE Redskins head coach Jay Gruden is on a collision course with his former offensive coordinator Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay and Gruden will partake in a game of minds during Sundays matchup at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Gruden and McVay both offensive minded coaches face the unique challenge of balancing both familiar schemes while also incorporating ones their opponent has never seen We have to be smart and aware that theyre very familiar with our scheme and with our personnel It is a unique situation so we have to be aware of that and plan accordingly Gruden said Theres always people in other buildings that have information or experience that they can share to try to help each end You just have to try to be a step ahead and have a plan to handle that Cousins on the other hand said he was more focused on the Rams players on the field rather than the coaches on the sideline According to him thats where the real battle will be on the turf I think Sean would tell you and we would say that ultimately it comes down to executing and if we can run our plays very detailed and be disciplined in the way we execute usually that can overcome familiarity Cousins said But certainly if we dont execute well it certainly gives them the opportunity to capitalize Cousins had his best year in McVays offense in 2016 throwing for 4917 yards and 25 touchdowns McVays impact can already be seen in Los Angeles where second year quarterback Jared Goff

is one of the NFLs top defensive players Selected in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft Donald is a threetime Pro Bowler twotime firstteam AllPro and was the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year at one point too In total hes recorded 164 tackles with 29 sacks seven passes defensed and four fumbles forced in his career to date Even though he hasnt played in an NFL game since January Were assuming hes playing 70 snaps Gruden said He doesnt come out in nickel he probably wont come out in base I dont know why you would take him out Im sure hes in good shape so I imagine well see a lot of Aaron Donald Regardless of how many snaps he appears on the Redskins know what sort of impact he can make In two career games against Washington Donald has totaled nine tackles with 15 sacks I wish he would have

him one of the most exciting young players in the league as a rookie The 2015 Offensive Rookie of the Year burst onto the NFL scene after an impressive career at Georgia After being selected at No 10 overall in the draft he lived up to his high expectations in his first year running for 1106 yards and 10 touchdowns While his numbers took a dip last year he still maintains an impressive set of tools argues Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a big threat He is still a good running back Gruden said this week He has great vision good sight lines He has got burst through the hole He is a good back Gurley kicked off his 2017 season with a soso performance last week against the Colts He struggled for the most part in the running game rushing for just 40 yards on 19 attempts but found the end zone once While he was unable to get much of anything going on the ground quarterback Jared Goff completed five passes to Gurley for 56 yards It was somewhat of an underwhelming performance as a rusher for Gurley but Gruden noted that he had a couple runs that were called back due to penalty Still in an offense that has a multitude of young and new faces Gurley remains a focal point Theyre going to give us a lot of different formations Gruden said A lot of changeoftempos offensively quick counts speed breaks no huddle a lot of different formations a lot of stacks and theyve got a good

       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 2 game against the Los Angeles Rams that took place at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 1 After a week in which the Redskins struggled to run the ball Washington breaks out with more than 200 yards on the ground In Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Redskins running backs accounted for just 34 rushing yards It was a different story on Sunday against a vaunted Los Angeles defense as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for 229 rushing yards All three running backs collected at least 65 yards on the ground marking the first time that has happened for the Redskins since the 1957 I think we just came out with the mindset we were going to run the ball enough so we did said Kelley who finished with 78 rushing yards on just 12 carries before being removed from the game with a rib injury I think we also run the ball I think he first couple plays we showed up and we were actually running it so coach stuck with it In the second quarter Thompson broke the game open with two touchdown runs On the first play of the quarter Thompson benefitted from setup blocks from Trent Williams and Terrelle Pryor Sr to take a pitch seven yards to the house Then just a few minutes later the shifty running back showed off his moves weaving in and out of the Rams defense for a 61yard score Thompson said the play was something the Redskins saw the Steelers use Weve seen LeVeon Bell he does it a lot Thompson said Its one of those plays where he has the option to run through a lot of different gaps and we thought we could possible get that going this week The Oline they did a great job and its all credit to them because they did such a good job at blocking Perine finished off the strong ground game performance on Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive as the rookie collected 38 rushing yards before Kirk Cousins found Ryan Grant for an 11yard touchdown I like the way he ran said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Hes a tough physical guy like we thought 2 Ryan Grant comes through with the biggest moment of his career to date Opportunities Thats been the buzzword with the Redskins coaching staff when it comes to the fourthyear veteran In his first three seasons in Washington Grant was hidden on the depth chart behind the likes of DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon But with the two veterans off the roster Grant has finally been given the opportunity to produce While the Tulane product was quiet for most of the day he hauled in the gamewinning score with less than two minutes left On 3 rd and5 from the 11yard line Grant lined up in a bunch formation on Cousins left After a slight delay off the line Grant ran out to his left before Cousins found him on the side of the end zone for a score It felt good man Grant said Everyones happy and our goal was to come in here and get the win and thats what we did As Washington seeks to get the passing game back on track after two quiet performances to start the season Cousins hopes to get Grant involved more He continues to show up on our practice film being wide open running really good routes Cousins said Ill work a go ball on the left and I can pick either side and Ryan is running by his defender on the other side It was great to get him a touchdown today Weve got to continue to get him involved and get him opportunities because hell prove his strength 3 A dislocated shoulder didnt stop Mason Foster from slamming the door shut on the Rams Even though Grants touchdown put the Redskins ahead with less than two minutes left Los Angeles still had time to piece together a potential gametying touchdown drive But Foster who had suffered a dislocated shoulder in the third quarter jumped a route intended for Cooper Kupp on Los Angeles first offensive play following the touchdown They had widened the stack out a little bit so I felt like earlier in the game I barely missed one and I told Kendall Fuller and Zach Brown next time we see it Im just going to go play it Im going to go jump it and it just so happens that the time that we saw it again was when we needed it the most Foster said But it was something that the coaches had alerted all week something that everybody talked about I just happened to be the one to make the play So its a great team win Foster has been impressive in the role of starting Mike linebacker for the Redskins this season Along with his gamesealing interception Foster also had six tackles and a pass defensed But the pick his first in three seasons with the Redskins capped off Washingtons lategame heroics I think he was waiting on that play the whole day said DJ Swearinger The linebackers were waiting on it the safeties the corners and we finally got it at the end of the game and he did what he was supposed to do to it Thats a great play by him and a great team win 4 The Redskins showed resiliency in the face of adversity Early on it looked as if the Redskins were going to easily handle the Rams Washington jumped out to a 100 lead and were primed to extend that lead to 170 after a Todd Gurley fumble But a drive that started at the Los Angeles 30yard stalled out with two incompletions on fade routes Still Dustin Hopkins was able to extend the lead to 130 But the Rams would fight back and score 10 unanswered points in the second half to knot the game at 20 apiece Between the gamewinning touchdown drive and Fosters interception though the Redskins did not break I think the guys just coming out here and battling four quarters and not threeandahalf said Josh Norman We did our job today and we executed Offensive line youve got to tip your hats off to those guys they are awesome There were role models today they did everything Give our running backs the rock they plow away and thats what you need from an offense like that Thompson was also pleased with how the Redskins fought back especially after a third quarter in which the offense was shut down In that third quarter our offense we couldnt get anything going and our defense continued to fight Thompson said They continued to help us stay in the game and they got us the ball back later in the game and we just made some plays I love this group Theres just something different with this group of guys that we have this year Were a lot closer everybodys like brothers out there You want to do things to not let your brothers down We made the necessary plays 5 As the offense still tries to seek an identity Cousins thinks the passing game will improve as time goes on Last season of course the Redskins were one of the best passing teams in the NFL Cousins nearly passed for 5000 yards while three different receivers posted at least 800 yards Through two games this year though the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific Through Sundays action Cousins ranks 16 th in passing yards 419 with just two touchdown passes In Sundays victory Cousins passes for just 179 yards with the late touchdown throw to Grant It was productive enough to get past the Rams but Cousins remains high on the potential of the passing attacks abilities I think were optimistic that right away we were going to be able to operate out of the gate Cousins said But when youre going against your own defense day after day after day it doesnt necessarily give you a great picture of what the real thing is going to look like against different teams every single week Were going to figure out an identity as we go and see what we do well Weve got to figure it out the sooner the better',\n",

       " 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda answers YOUR questions submitted on Twitter about the Redskins roster and more as the team prepares for a Week 3 matchup with the Raiders at FedExField NPHarris 4 asks What is the defensive plan for stopping Oaklands running game HailMail Once again the Redskins will face another one of the leagues toughest running backs in the form of fivetime Pro Bowler Marshawn Lynch Despite spending the 2016 season in retirement Lynch appears to have not missed a beat so far in his first year with Oakland In two games so far this year Lynch has carried the ball 30 times for 121 yards and one touchdown In a blowout victory over the New York Jets last Sunday Lynchs workload was light He carried the ball only 12 times on just 23 offensive plays After struggling to slow down opposing running games last year Washington has shown growth in that category this season Yes Todd Gurley was able to rush for 88 yards last week but Washington is currently ninth against the run so far this year allowing just 75 rushing yards per contest One key to the teams early success stopping the run has been their ability to wreak havoc without giving up big plays The Redskins are one of just two teams in the NFL right now to have forced three fumbles without giving up a 20yard run The goal this week will be to remain aggressive against Beast Mode and an Oakland rushing attack that also includes Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington We might give up a run here and there but at the end of the day were going to come after you were going to tackle you said Redskins linebacker Zach Brown It doesnt matter who you are because some of us have already played against Marshawn when he was with the Seahawks So for us it was the same guy that was at the Seahawks but you know hes just got a better Oline So when we hit him we just have to make sure we keep driving our feet John G asks Hopkins has now missed 2 field goals in two games Should we be worried HailMail Yes Hopkins missed a 51yard field goal attempt in last Sundays victory over the Los Angeles Rams when he had enough power to hit the lengthy attempt but clanked it off one of the uprights but the 26yearold remains one of the best players at his position today It is one of the main reasons why Washington didnt bring in any kicking competition for Hopkins during the offseason I think hes a young kid and I think hes worth having here said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden last month I dont think we really need to bring in a lot of competition but we have a list of players to bring in if they struggle just like everybody else at every other position But I have total confidence that the specialists wont struggle and theyre going to be a great weapon for us Hop can bang it Between Washingtons four preseason and two regular season games this year Hopkins is 10of12 on his field goal attempts and a perfect 10of10 on extra point tries He has also had six of his kickoffs downed for touchdowns tied for the 11 th best mark through two weeks Field goals of 50plus yards are far from automatic as last Sunday proved for Hopkins But he has shown the past that he can kicks from that distance While Hopkins started strong before dealing with some inconsistencies midway through last season the Redskins remain high on the fourthyear Florida State product DorianB asks How much Samaje should we expect with Kelley being Day to day This will be something that well have to monitor as the week progresses Kelley as you mentioned is currently daytoday as he deals with a rib injury suffered in the second quarter of Washingtons victory over the Rams Hell have three days of practices to test the injury but if he cant play on Sunday the team will likely look to rookie Samaje Perine as the featured back with Chris Thompson and Mack Brown serving their own roles After not playing offensive snaps in Washingtons regular season opener against the Eagles Perine appeared on 26 plays against Los Angeles defense The Oklahoma product got off to a bit of a slow start as he had just 12 yards on his first five carries But as the game wore on Perine started to get into a groove On Washingtons 10play 70yard gamewinning drive late in the fourth quarter the 5foot11 236 pounder carried the ball seven times for 38 yards I think I felt him run with a lot of power Gruden said Even after his 10 th 12 th 15 th carry I still think he had power left in the tank which was good to see A lot of times you dont know how their stamina is going to be when they get more than 1012 carries but I think his stamina was outstanding and he ran with great pad level and got the tough physical yards we needed Some have wondered if it should be Thompson as the feature back if Kelley is sidelined especially with his redhot start to this season But Gruden doesnt want to expand Thompsons role too much Chris has got such a defined role for this offense and it could be expanded but hes so important to us on third down we just have to be careful Gruden said Hes not the biggest guy in the world We dont want him to get 2025 carries a game and get a lot of pounding on that body Hes definitely needed in pass protection and the routes and all that stuff on third down and red zone So well try to expand his role a little bit but we dont want to go too crazy with him',\n",

       " 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 He loves the versatility Chris Thompson brings Its no question the Redskins offense has benefited greatly from running back Chris Thompsons play through two games this season The thirddown back whose role may increase more depending on the health status of starter Rob Kelley has scored three of the teams four offensive touchdowns thus far increasing his playmaking while continuing to be a supreme passblocker The quickspark ability has made it easier on quarterback Kirk Cousins whose load has been lightened by Thompsons versatility The Florida State product has gained 81 yards both rushing and receiving providing a changeup from the more punishing running style of Kelley and Samaje Perine Cousins ran off a laundry list of the things Thompson does well He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Cousins said There is just a lot to like and the other thing about Chris that you have to know from his story is it wasnt like he showed up as a rookie and was an AllPro It took time to develop and thats the case with so many guys in this league He has got a great demeanor about him Cousins added He is very composed very intelligent good teammate I told him that I said Youre the kind of guy I want in the huddle in a tense moment in an away stadium just because you feel like he is a guy who has composure about him and the moment is not too big for him So cant say enough good things about Chris and hopefully continue to lean on him I think we will continue to lean on him because of the mismatches he can create on linebackers and things like that 2 Thompsons conscientious mentality is an example of the strong locker room the team has The Thompson love continued when Cousins was asked about how Thompson felt bad that he couldnt collect a pass in the Rams game that could have potentially gone for another long score Thompson lamented the fact that the catch would have likely given Cousins more than 200 yards passing It was another small example of a player thinking about his teammate Ive said it many times and hopefully it translates to wins I dont know that it always does but we do have a really good locker room Cousins said It is examples like that where players are thinking of other players that makes a big difference The second the ball left my hand and we didnt complete it I said to myself I threw it too hard I didnt give him a chance to really catch it I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward 3 With more reps hell have more opportunities to find Josh Doctson in the passing game A few times during Sundays game against the Rams wide receiver Josh Doctson slipped out of coverage and had an opportunity for a big pass play but Cousins didnt look his way That was due to a variety of things reading the defense differently having pressure in his face reasons why the two havent connected so far in the regular season That figures to change eventually and Doctsons full participation at practice Wednesday and presumably for the entire week should help get them on a better rapport come Sunday night against the Raiders Every play is different but you always have your reads and where your eyes are and you focus downfield and you try to feel the pass rush Cousins said There are times where you stand in there and make the throw which I have done many times There is times where you eat it and you take the sack to avoid a tipped ball or an interception or whatever it may be Theres times where you have enough time to throw the ball the way to avoid the sack but you also knew that the read downfield wasnt declaring and so rather than throwing it into a gray window you just throw the ball away Those are those splitsecond decisions that you try to train through muscle memory with a lot of practice reps and game reps Thats something that I think I am continuing to get better and better at 4 He respects Oaklands football culture and its premier defenders The first attribute that impressed Cousins about the teams next opponent the Raiders was their culture change over the last couple of years with quarterback Derek Carr under center Then he turned to their defense specifically defensive end Khalil Mack and linebacker Bruce Irvin who hes faced before when playing against Seattle Khalil Mack is as good as they come in the NFL and Bruce Irvin Ive played against when he was in Seattle and hes a very active player both in the pass game and in the run game Cousins said Very athletic in space Obviously we know David Amerson and the player that hes become Theyve got experienced players they had a great year and went to the playoffs last year for a reason and theyre 20 for a reason Very good defense Head coach Jay Gruden mentioned that Oakland mixes up its front seven really well making it challenging to know what kind of blitz packages are coming If the run game can sustain itself that should ease some of the pressure 5 Though the passing game hasnt quite clicked yet hes optimistic it will improve Cousins has thrown for just 419 yards in his first two regular season games putting him below pace from the past two years of prolific offense There are a variety of factors contributing to this slower start a dropped pass here a missed read there but Cousins remains confident that the pass offense will progress in the coming weeks especially if the run game can provide them more opportunities for playaction I would like to think that as the year goes on the offense gets better and better Cousins said Sometimes around this league I dont know I would be interested to do a study to see do offenses tend to take more time to get going than defenses in this league I wonder I know for me these last couple seasons weve gotten stronger as the year has gone on offensively and have gotten an identity and kind of gotten a better understanding of what we do well and how to make that

really good things the first two weeks and have moved the ball but I think there is more in the tank there that we have got to bring out',\n",

       " 'The outside linebacker enters his seventh year in Washington having never missed a game in his career He reflects on a variety of topics including his social media habits his desire to stay in the DCarea and what he aspires to do after his football life finishes Is there a better feeling on the field than grabbing a picksix I would say a picksix in a win would be the only better feeling Two of my picksixes have come in losses the first one came in a win It was definitely a lot easier to enjoy after the win than it was after the losses Its definitely exciting because you catch the ball you kind of realize youre in the open by the crowds reaction because theyre cheering they know youre going to score At that point its just pure joy I can imagine when youre touching the football its a weird experience It is a little bit especially when youre running with it Its one thing to dive on it in a pile and just cover it but to catch it and run the other way and score with it its a little nervewracking because youre like hows my ball security going to be if I do encounter someone that wants to tackle me and how do I defeat someone if theyre going to try and tackle me Its definitely weird for a defender to do it but its a great feeling nonetheless Youre a mildmannered guy off the field and the opposite on the field Is it strange when you think about that dichotomy If you actually sit down and think about it yeah You think like Ok I have to be really aggressive violent and try to destroy the guy Im going against on the field but off the field Im pretty quiet pretty reserved nonconfrontational Its pretty interesting when you think about it I guess you have to have that to live a balanced life Oh you have to have that You dont want to be both on both fields You dont want to be nice off the field and nice on the field You dont want to be mean on the field and mean off the field You got to find the balance I know its clich to flip the switch Was passrusher a position you always wanted to play Yeah ever since I started playing tackle in fifth grade I was a defensive lineman partially because I was too heavy to carry the ball Otherwise I might have tried to play quarterback or something else Ive been playing defensive line and rushing the quarterback pretty much my whole football life Is there a big difference for you when you go through a variety of linebackers coaches as you have in your career A little bit Anytime you have a switch in coaches its obviously a change but I mean I think you just try to absorb as much as you can from each coach because theyre all going to help you take your game to another level Your birthday was last month How did you celebrate My fiance went down to the city and we went to Bens Chili Bowl Thats my first time going to the U Street original Thats kind of my thing Anytime I get a free chance I want to go to the city and just experience something new in the city because theres so much to do here in DC Thats kind of my thing Some guys go to the country I head east Did you at least have a nice dinner though We went to Eddie Vs in Tysons for dinner So I got one halfsmoke at Bens for the experience and then went to Eddie Vs afterwards Do you have any pressure around birthdays to make it a big day Honestly my birthdays always been during training camp so its never really been a big celebration thing to where Im like Im going to do this Im going to go out its always been whatever day of the week it is for me Since Ive been with my fiance birthdays have always been a big thing for her so shes always made my birthdays a big deal and always has balloons and cooks for me Its definitely changed since shes come into the picture So are you a little spoiled The past few Ive definitely been spoiled Is that the biggest difference being engaged now Yes Im definitely more spoiled on my birthdays now Its a point of emphasis for her and she takes pride in making it a good birthday You also help run your bulldogs Instagram account Did you realize this was going to be a thing I really had no idea Whats really funny is well be walking around Reston Town Center with the dogs and well get stopped by someone thatll say We follow your dogs on Instagram I cant believe its them Its like What These people are fans of my dogs Did you set up the Instagram first No my fiance did She set it up Ill throw up a post every once in a while but shes the wizard with it gets the pictures all right Its crazy to see the following Theyre awesome dogs Do you have more fun posting about dogs or posting on your own account The posts on my dogs account are more frequent so Id say on my account if Im posting about something Im really feeling Ok I want to get this out there because I want to make my posts unique and not so frequent Whats the main reason you dont tweet as much as some of your teammates I dont know I get on Twitter all the time Im probably on Twitter as much as anybody I just never post anything I just like to see what other people post Honestly I dont really have a lot to say both in person and on Twitter I guess you can leave the posting to your fiance Yeah shes a more frequent poster than I am She probably does a better job of keeping people up to date with what Im doing outside of football than I do Thats one of the perks of being engaged I ask because I know its easy to get jealous or annoyed with people who post a lot Is that maybe a reason for your smaller presence Yeah I see people who post all the time and there might not be a lot of difference in what they post one day to the next Oh hey Im working out today Next day Oh hey Im working out Its like alright we get it you like to work out I dont want anybody to ever feel like all he posts about is his dogs or football I want to keep a little variety and not oversaturate it Do you struggle with comparing yourself to other people On social media or on the football field No I wouldnt say that Where does the competitive edge come from Are you good at motivating yourself Yeah definitely because I feel like I have a lot of abilities and I have a lot of talent and a lot of good fortune in my life So I feel like I owe it to myself and everyone around me to work hard and be the best I can be Have you allowed yourself to think about the next step after football Yeah you try to think about what you want to do how you want to stay busy how you want to contribute to society and Ive got some ideas in mind and you always want to be prepared to make the right step now so when youre done you can make a smooth transition Ive got some things in mind Do you care to share any of them I know youve expressed interest in wanting to be on camera I would like that especially in Washington DC theres so much opportunity for that Obviously getting to stay in the area would be a dream come true for me so something footballrelated Ill have to do something footballrelated whether its coaching at one level or another high school college pro or doing something mediarelated I feel like it would have to be football or sportsrelated because Im too much of a sports guy to do something completely different Ive been told Big Ten network is a big love of yours I mean the BTN is you heard right Is that just the Purdue connection I guess I just associate the Big Ten network with falls in Big Ten country across the Midwest I had a lot of fond memories growing up in that time and playing college football in that area Thats probably where the fondness comes from Is it tough to stay present sometimes when you have ideas for the future and want to make connections throughout the year Id say its easy to stay present Its tough to think too far ahead in the future and try to do too much to prepare I still want to play football for a long time Thats my focus today and every day Whats something about Indiana most people dont know about I feel like in Indiana we have the hottest of the hot and the coldest of the cold weatherwise People always think that its this cold place but in the summertime it can get hot as hell there and its humid It can be in the high 90s low 100s but then in the winter it can be minus10 So its pretty unique in that theres so much variety And Indianapolis has those overhead walkways like Minneapolis because its so cold Right Another thing that weve got in Indiana is that people are so kind and friendly Midwest people are and I know the term salt of the earth get thrown around a lot but really its true Theyre good wholesome people and theyd give you the shirt off their back Do you think youd like to move back there or are you content to leave that as your childhood home I love it here now so if I could ultimately stay in the DC area that would be awesome Ive really grown to love the area Ill always love Indiana and everything about it But Im here now and hope to be for a long time Is there something in football that you feel is underreported Id say the daytoday making sure your body is ready to not only get ready for Sunday but get right for practice that day the amount of time you have to put in to get your body ready for practice and the different treatment youve got to do both here at the facility and then at home to make sure your body is ready for the game Because when we leave here we might be here for 1112 hours a day when we leave here the football doesnt really stop for a lot of us We go home and we watch film and we have to ice down what may be bothering us and do some stretching and whatnot Long story short all the extra stuff youve got to do Its not just practicing its not just watching film Its stretching after practice its foamrolling its watching film on your own making sure youre eating the right foods all the little things that are personal decisions that arent necessarily required by the coaching staff that really give a lot of guys an edge And thats something you take a lot of pride in Definitely Its not only something that helps me for each Sunday but it helps your body to feel better in general so that you can prolong your football career Speaking of which whats the shake youve been drinking as weve talked VegaOne Its a veganprotein plantbased protein Is this new This is new I did some bloodwork and found I had a wheyprotein intolerance so I started doing the plantbased So far so good So far so good It doesnt taste as good as whey but its a lot better for you so Ill take that Youre a fan favorite here Whats the strangest thing someones sent to you unsolicited Ive been invited to a number of peoples weddings The thing about that thats crazy to me is like it will be a really nice invitation so you can tell this is not just a wedding theyre throwing together in someones backyard This is like a really nice event Theyre inviting me and I dont know who they are But you have a place at their table To me thats like these people must really think a lot of me to invite me to their wedding If you have a free weekend and you had an invitation would you ever go to one You know what I want to I do want to one of these days because it would obviously mean something to them if theyre willing to invite me and if I were to show up Im sure it would mean something to them Maybe one day Ill do that Hopefully they can give me a plusone so my fiance can come I would think its risky because you might take all the attention away from the bride and groom Thats true You wouldnt want that And that would just be bad in general because Im not like the life of the party guy If Im the life of your party your party probably sucks Maybe you could just have a pen at the ready for autographs on the wedding line Yeah get out there for Shout and call it a day',\n",
       " 'Washingtons thirddown running back has dealt with a turbulent NFL career while overcoming his own self doubts Now he is thriving in his fourth year with the Redskins In the NFL change is inevitable Most of the time change comes at the benefit of player whether it be to maximize a certain skill or fill a need for the team Chris Thompson faced his fair share of change after leaving Florida State for the NFL Draft When he wasnt battling injuries while playing for the Seminoles Thompson was out on the field as much as possible However two seasonending injuries in his junior and senior years hurt his draft stock Once the Washington Redskins selected Thompson in the fifth round in 2013 it was clear his role in the game would soon change I think for me it was more mental than anything I had to learn over time It wasnt easy Thompson said Its something that I have to get used to but over time I started to get more and more comfortable Once I got comfortable with myself being in that role then I was able to execute better Thompsons new role includes being a primarily thirddown back in charge of giving the offense the extra push when it matters most along with returning kicks This new position came after years of being jostled around the roster going back and forth to the practice squad before finally signing an extension with the team in early September In Week 1 Thompson scored Washingtons only offensive touchdown of the game off a pass from quarterback Kirk Cousins In Week 2 Thompsons role became paramount when fellow running back Rob Kelley went down with an injury during the third quarter While rookie Samaje Perine took most of the handoffs it was Thompson who put up the big numbers On just three carries he scored two touchdowns and amassed 77 yards He also made contributions in the passing game with three catches for 29 yards Chris is one of our best players and is a tremendous asset to our offense because he is so versatile Cousins said He can pass protect He can catch the football He can run good routes He is a smart player He is a good teammate He runs the ball well He can hit the home run He can make people miss Thompsons day was not completely highlight filled however Some costly and avoidable mistakes kept him from turning in an almost spotless game Thompson failed to haul in what would have been a 60yard touchdown pass from Cousins early in the second half Im not going to lie to you on the plane ride getting dressed after the game this morning watching film when I was outside at practice I was thinking about that one play Thompson said My first thing I wanted to do when I got out there in individuals with the quarterbacks was to run that route again and catch the ball Thompson said one of the reasons he was bitter was that it kept Cousins from breaking 200 yards passing He said with that one catch he could have silenced those who question how balanced the Redskins offense is Cousins meanwhile said when a play falls through its never just one players fault I didnt give him a chance to really catch it Cousins said I rifled it and needed to just throw a more catchable ball So we are all being critical of ourselves and finding ways that we individually can play better so that collectively as a group we can have improvement going forward Thompson said he often thinks this way after a costly mistake in a game He said it can be both a blessing and a curse always evaluating his game and trying to improve but sometimes spends too much time dwelling on his failures Yeah and people say that Im too hard on myself but thats just me Thats who I am Theres a lot of things I can go and look back on Thompson said Its something that as a human you have to let it go you have to move on but for me that motivates me to be better on the next play moving forward',\n",

       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 6 game against the San Francisco 49ers that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 Despite dealing with a major case of the injury bug the defense held on when it counted most In a back and forth fourth quarter the 49ers go one finally chance at a comeback victory with 52 seconds left on the clock While Washingtons improved defense got the upper hand on San Franciscos offense early particularly when Brian Hoyer was in the game the unit was banged up Cornerback Bashaud Breeland knee and defensive lineman Jonathan Allen foot both suffered gameending injuries Cornerback Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett of course wasnt playing either while safety DJ Swearinger briefly exited the contest with a stinger Quickly the 49ers got things rolling against the hampered defensive unit In just four plays San Francisco got to Washingtons 40yard line off two big catches by former Redskins wide receiver Pierre Garon But the receivers aggressive nature would ultimately cost his team their first victory of the season Called for offensive pass interference San Francisco was pushed back to the 50yard line They would never get back into field goal range as cornerback Kendall Fuller iced the game with his second interception of the season on a fourth down throw from CJ Beathard We were just kind of playing the sticks trying to make sure they dont get a first down at the same time trying to protect the sidelines Fuller said Definitely a good play call for the coaches The cornerback added that although the 49ers got into field goal range down just two points the defense never get nervous and never lost confidence We knew it was going to be a dog fight and weve just got to keep on fighting Fuller said 2 Outside of an errant pass that was picked quarterback Kirk Cousins once again was effective for the Redskins For the third time in as many games the Redskins offense scored on the units opening drive After receiving the opening kickoff against the 49ers Cousins drove the offense 75 yards in eight plays capped by an 11yard score from wide receiver Josh Doctson It was the first of three touchdowns on the afternoon for Cousins who also connected with Samaje Perine for a score and scampered in for a sevenyard touchdown in the fourth quarter In total Cousins passes for I think we did a good job as an offense Cousins said I think we moved the football There were a lot of good decisions a lot of good plays made a lot of thirddown conversions in big moments a lot of crucial drives where we had to churn the clock and come away with points So I was proud of the way our offense played today It wasnt perfect there were a couple mistakes but all in all we did a lot of good things Cousins touchdown run early in the fourth quarter was actually the gamewinning score for the Redskins On the option run Cousins pulled the ball back from Perine before running to his right unevaded into the end zone Its always been there because you know I would credit going back to my rookie year with Robert Griffin III here we did it a lot Cousins said Its always going to be a part of our offense because it does give defenses something to think about Kyle Shanahan told me when he left he said Ive learned after working with Robert that this is a really valuable play no matter who the quarterback is and Ill always carry it with me So when Jay Gruden arrived we kept it and valued it and as I started playing it can still be a great play You just have to pick your spots be smart with it call it at the right times and read it correctly and then usually you can get some yards 3 The young players particularly in the secondary stepped up At one of the deepest position groups on the roster the Redskins needed all of their active defensive backs on Sunday Normally of course the Redskins have Norman and Breeland as the starting cornerbacks But Norman missed the entire game with a rib injury while Breeland briefly dealt with a hamstring issue before a knee injury suffered when 49ers tackle Joe Staley rolled up on him knocked the Clemson product out of the contest In their place Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau saw significant reps Even seventhround pick Joshua Holsey logged snaps on the final drive It was the first time he ever played on defense in his nascent NFL career No dropoffs we prepare Dunbar said of the young defensive backs Everybody prepares like starters Coach Greg Manusky helping us through the week helping us during the week to prepare everybody like starters so that when you get in they expect you to play like a starter Swearinger told the defensive backs that theyre only as good as their weakest link In his eyes though the unit has no weak lines The next player up if the next player prepares hes going to be good Swearinger said Perfect preparation prevents poor performance and I tell the guys that all the time and we performed well 4 Chris Thompson and Vernon Davis continue to be the goto targets in the passing game but others had their contributions too On an afternoon in which Cousins completed 25 passes his top two receivers once again were Thompson and Davis While neither found the end zone on Sunday both continued their strong starts to the season Thompson notched his second career 100yard receiving game as the Florida State product became just the second Redskins running back with multiple 100yard receiving games in a season since 1960 In total he caught four passes for 105 yards highlighted by a 49yard reception on a 1 st and22 pass The offensive linemen are all blocking their guys great and Ive been given some oneonone opportunities and just winning those matchups Thompson said Thats pretty much the key to it I had three screen plays today my first three catches And my Oline did a great job downfield Jordan Reed the receivers all those guys did just a great job blocking for me Its on me to make plays and be a playmaker be a difference maker on this team Davis meanwhile avenged a third quarter fumble with a 51yard catchandrun in the fourth quarter in the first game facing the team that drafted him No 6overall in the 2006 NFL Draft Including a 69yard catch against Kansas City Davis has now posted a reception of 50 yards or more in consecutive games for the first time since Weeks 56 of the 2013 season as a member of the 49ers 5 After not being able to do anything physical for two weeks Trent Williams played the entire game Originally suffering a knee injury during training camp earlier this year the issue resurfaced two weeks ago against the Kansas City Chiefs Missing four plays in the game Williams did not practice throughout the entire week leading up to Sundays home contest against the 49ers For most such an injury would keep them out for a few weeks But Williams isnt your average player The fivetime Pro Bowler said he knew he was going to be good on Saturday evening Just a few hours later he played all 70 offensive plays for Washington I didnt necessarily feel like myself but thats expected Williams admitted I havent done anything with football in the last two weeks I felt rusty It was kind of hard early trying to fight through the rust and everything but once you start getting in the flow of the game and the adrenaline starts rushing you kind of start to worry about the game more than anything Williams presence was certainly felt as the 2010 firstround pick didnt allow a young and talent defensive line any sacks from his side In total San Francisco tallied just one sack of Cousins For us man we know what weve got hes our leader said tackle Morgan Moses He doesnt have to practice all week but we know hes going to show up on the game Hes just mentally and physically there Thats what you expect out of a Pro Bowl tackle Cousins added that he wasnt entirely sure if Williams was going to play the entire game In the end though the quarterbacks sturdy left tackle was there for him You prepare for the worst and hope for the best and Trent did a great job playing through his injury Cousins said Im a little spoiled having him as a left tackle and when hes in there it makes a big difference',\n",

Lynch returned to the NFL this year following a trade from the Seattle Seahawks to his hometown Raiders While the sample size has been small so far 30 carries for 121 yards Lynch clearly hasnt missed a beat this year The Redskins know this and plan to be ready for the exact same player that has been named to five Pro Bowls and has six 1000yard seasons Its just going to be a group effort like it is with every great back in the NFL that you face said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Todd Gurleys a different type of back but you know it takes more than one He might jump over one guy and the next guys going to have to come get him Marshawn might stiff arm one guy but the next two or three guys are going to come get himIts got to be a group effort and weve got to run to the football all 11 of them on defense have got to pursue to the football with great passion Lynch is coming off a fairly light workload following Oaklands blowout victory over the New York Jets last Sunday He appeared on just 23 offensive plays and logged just 12 carries Redskins linebacker Mason Foster said the team needs to swarm to the ball whenever it is in Lynchs possession Everybodys going to have to tackle well and be physical but at the same time you know guys are going to miss because hes a great back but everybody has to be flying to the ball Foster said So if one guy misses or if one guy slips off someone is right there to make a tackle Its about team defense and its going to take all 11 guys to get to the ball Stephen Czarda CONTINUE THE BALANACED ATTACK Even though quarterback Kirk Cousins passed for nearly 5000 yards last season the passing game hasnt been quite as prolific so far this year After Cousins threw for just 240 yards and three touchdowns in an opening game loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the Los Angeles Rams held the Pro Bowl quarterback to just 179 yards on 18 completions It was the fewest passing yards he had in a game since Week 17 of the 2015 season when he only played to the early minutes of the second quarter in a game one week after the Redskins clinched the NFC East While Washington certainly wants more production from Cousins the running game burst onto the scene last Sunday as Rob Kelley Chris Thompson and Samaje Perine combined for more than 220 yards Facing an offense this week that can put up points in bunches a similar outing by the running backs could go a long way in getting the Redskins their first victory at FedExField this year Anytime you add balance into your offense it opens up all the different areas said tackle Trent Williams If you can run the ball it keeps the chains in manageable distance it opens up your playbook to a lot more options and plays that you can pick Gruden added that being multidimensional on offense is going to be important determining factor between wins and losses and the season wears on Attacking a Raiders defense that currently ranks 19 th against the run while getting the passing game clicking could keep Oakland off balance just enough to grab a victory The ability to run the ball is a great asset for us and its necessary for us to be successful longterm Gruden said For us to get to the playoffs and win Super Bowls we have to be balanced and we have to be able to run the ball to take the pressure off our quarterback and open up the play actions Stephen Czarda TURN THE CARR AROUND Coming into Week 3 Oaklands offense ranks fourth in the NFL in yards per game This no doubt is due to the so far flawless play of quarterback Derek Carr The fourthyear passer out of Fresno State has thrown five touchdowns this season with no interceptions In two games he has amassed 492 yards through the air and has only been sacked two times Gruden said thats where his team needs to excel getting to Carr before the ball leaves his hand It gets frustrating for pass rushers You know you say Rush the quarterback rush the quarterback and the balls gone at one point I think the average was under two seconds that he gets the ball out of his hands Gruden said Well get our hands up maybe bat some balls but still I think if you make the quarterback uncomfortable even if you dont get the sack it can be equally as important as getting the sack The Redskins defense who through two games has recorded four sacks will have its hands full trying to bring down the 6foot3 215pound Carr who sits behind a stellar offensive line and has plenty of talented receivers to dump the ball off to in no time Receiver Michael Crabtree for instance caught three touchdowns last week against the New York Jets Our defensive line and linebackers will be challenged Gruden said Theyre anxious Theyre excited It will be a great test Brandon Hill SHINE UNDER THE BRIGHT LIGHTS FedExField will be at the

       " 'The Raiders were the team that brought Terrelle Pryor Sr into the NFL as he played quarterback for Oakland for a few seasons Now hes one of the Redskins starting wide receivers with a 1000yard receiving season under his belt Its a transition few have ever made and almost none have seen the same sort of early returns Terrelle Pryor Sr was best known as an Ohio StateturnedNFL quarterback who didnt quite pan out in the professional ranks Selected in the third round of the 2011 NFL Supplemental Draft Pryor produced mediocre results in his two seasons as a quarterback for the Oakland Raiders Between the 201213 seasons Pryor completed 56 percent of his pass attempts with just nine touchdown passes to 12 interceptions With the Raiders in the market for a future franchise quarterback Pryor was traded to the Seattle Seahawks in April 2014 Despite offseason roster stints with the Seahawks Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns Pryor wouldnt appear in an NFL game again until Week 17 of the 2015 season as a wide receiver With his desire to continue playing football Pryor elected to make the switch to wide receiver It turned an NFL career in jeopardy into one of the best success stories of the 2016 season as Pryor totaled 77 receptions for 1007 yards and four touchdowns with the Browns He posted these numbers despite having almost no stability from Clevelands quarterback position Not many people have ever done it before but he is a big physical great athlete said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden And it helps to be 6foot5 and run a 43 40 yard dash I think had he made this decision sooner in his career I think hed be further along But being that he just made it not too long ago hes where he is I mean hes still one of the top guys in the league and he just started playing Hes a physical freak Indeed others who have gone from quarterback to wide receiver havent had 1000yard seasons like Pryor Former Redskins wide receiver Antwaan Randle El for example went from a college quarterback at Indiana to NFL wideout But he never posted more than 730 receiving yards in any of his nine professional seasons Most former quarterbacks you put them in a situation where now they are getting hit a lot more exposed a lot to a lot more situations in terms of the physical aspect of the game You think they tend to turn a lot of stuff down he doesnt do that said Redskins wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard He plays the game aggressively and hes made the transition well But the transition wasnt exactly as it looked on the field last year Pryor had to learn some of the simplest traits of the position let alone prepare for seasoned NFL defensive backs starring him down Tim Cortazzo my trainer he spent three four hours a day not just outside running routes but also going indoors running around cones because I really didnt know how to handle my body I didnt know how to adjust my body I didnt know how to take control of myself Pryor said Now Im at the point where I can control my body I know where Im going I know what I want to do to the defender I know how to stare at the guy in his eyes and make him think that Im doing something else and then try to do something else Thats what I continue to get better at stuff like that While hes now known as a wide receiver his background at the quarterback position hasnt gone to waste On the contrary hes benefitted from knowing what its like to be the one in charge of an offense I just like the fact that hes a very bright guy understands coverages understands where the ball should go and route concepts which is very big Gruden said He is a very smart receiver now its just about polishing up the little things and the details of each route and were working with him on that Polishing up the intricacies hasnt been perfect for Pryor as would be the case for any player making a change in their 20s after spending their entire upbringing at a different position Pryor was active on social media during the offseason showcasing his hard work posting almost daily his progress Some days of course were better than others But the 28yearold wanted to show people that his success last season was no fluke When you go and have an excellent season or do some great things people know why Pryor said of his workout videos on social media Little kids know why Maybe thatll get kids outside to work out more and work hard people that look up to me people that I inspire So I think thats another reason thats a little deeper for me Late in the offseason Pryor posted a series of workout videos that showed him both following and competing with AllPro Antonio Brown When I talk about a freak mind like a weirdo freak in terms of everything has to be perfect watching Antonio work out it just changed my whole mindset of how youre supposed to be as a wideout Pryor said Its just the little details I was telling you guys earlier hell do three four reps in a row and then hell take a break because that next rep he wants that to be 100 percent and he wants it to be perfect And thats all you want to do is chase perfection and thats what Im looking forward to and Im just going to continue to grow from that standpoint While his workout posts have decreased now that the season has arrived his mindset in terms of hard work pays off hasnt During the preseason Pryor would spend as much as 30 minutes after practice working with starting quarterback Kirk Cousins As soon as we got done with practice I came over to Kirk and I was like Hey lets get this route and he was like Man you read my mind I was about to grab you Pryor said last month We started hitting it and then we started clicking and making it work and we started hitting them every time Cousins was appreciative of Pryors request to spend extra time together I think weve said it all along that one of the benefits of working with Terrelle is that he just really loves football Cousins said And thats evident with the fact that he wants to stay after practice he wants to talk about the routes and the nuances of it I think again what some of the stuff were working on goes back to the fact that as good as he is as talented as he is theres still a lot more there We think that as he continues to fine tune and understand what we want to do here in our offense he hopefully can just keep getting better and better I enjoy playing with him and I take it upon myself to get him the football give him opportunities Hes so talented and he has such a good heart and works so hard I want to make sure hes given a chance to be really successful and have a great year this year',\n",

efficient and had the flashes of brilliance that head coach Jay Gruden had been waiting to see erupt from his quarterback and stable of weapons In essence the Redskins made the plays they expected from themselves Cousins made smart decisions with the football completing 25of30 passes for 365 yards three touchdowns and no interceptions He distributed the ball to eight different receivers using a diversity of throws to connect on reliable short and screen passes and for the first time this season the deep ball He was also for the second consecutive game afforded a run game which tallied 116 yards to anchor his arm It was enough to pile up 472 total yards and a renewed confidence in Cousins and the talent around him against a strong Oakland defense You can look at the yards and say obviously I like the yards and the completion percentage but really I think there were some decisions that Kirk made that were equally as impressive not forcing the ball running the ball when we had a couple of bad looks protecting the football head coach Jay Gruden said We had a third down and five and he ran it we kicked a field goal to go up 17 he couldve forced it in there and made a bad decision I think he really managed the game perfectly He made some bigtime throws the receivers made some plays for him so all around I was very impressed with the entire offense moving the ball The scoring started early and provided a window into the rest of the nights crisp play Without tight end Jordan Reed in the lineup Vernon Davis stepped up to fill the void grabbing a 26yard pass over the middle beautifully placed into his outstretched hands to convert on the first third down which the Redskins handled 7of15 times Sunday night After several small gains from running back Samaje Perine Cousins then found Chris Thompson wide open to his left and the running back began another memorable night with a 22yard touchdown catch and run Thompson would figure mightily into the offensive production again he totaled 150 yards receiving and 38 yards rushing on the night as would Davis who caught Cousinss second touchdown pass a 19yard strike that hit him in stride to extend Washingtons lead in the second quarter Even with its numerous setbacks the majority of them drivekilling penalties the offense continued to play a complete game dominating in time of possession the Redskins racked more than 38 minutes compared to the Raiders 21 and feeding off the defenses continual quick stops As Thompson said our defense when they play that way it makes the offense play even harder Perine ran the ball for 49 yards and milked the clock throughout drives while Jamison Crowder Ryan Grant and Terrelle Pryor Sr all helped extending drives on third down The most noteworthy and electric strike came in the third quarter when Cousins lofted a deep pass down the right sideline to wide receiver Josh Doctson the teams firstround pick last year who was without a catch in this young season Using all of the physical tools he has been gifted Doctson leapt over Raiders cornerback David Amerson and grabbed the football in front of him forcing his way into the end zone after landing for a 52yard touchdown the first of his career Any time you start fast you know its up and down plays happen you can easily give the ball back quarterback Kirk Cousins said You can have a bad decision here or there and miss the read The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played There remain items to correct and improvements to be made But this output was a sign that the pieces to the offensive puzzle are taking shape moving from abstraction to clarity This is what we want and I believe thats what we know were capable of doing Thompson said So we just have to continue to get better every day in practice and then come out here and execute and Coach Gruden Ive said it so many times He just called the perfect plays He called all the right plays and the right times and it was just on us to win our matchups I think everybody collectively did a good job today',\n",
       " 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was an 11play 72yard scoring drive finished off by a Vernon Davis 18yard touchdown catch that gave the Redskins a twoscore lead Without tight end Jordan Reed available Sunday night against the Raiders quarterback Kirk Cousins and the Redskins leaned on Vernon Davis to make up for any lost production Once again the veteran tight end came through After already snagging a 26yard pass in the first quarter to convert on the teams first thirddown which led to an opening drive touchdown Davis continued to be a reliable target In the second quarter he streaked over the middle beating cornerback Sean Smith and grabbed a perfectly placed pass near the back of the end zone for the Redskins second touchdown of the night It capped an 11play 72yard drive that ate up six minutes and 10 seconds in the teams decisive 2710 victory over Oakland the product of another balanced offensive attack It looked to me that they did split safety coverage They played man up on Vernon Cousins said The goal was to beat his man down the field to find a seam between the two safeties and I just have to throw it out there Vernon is a big asset to our team You know that Jordan Reed is not always healthy The fact that Vernon has the speed that he has and the experience and can make the plays with the last year and half what an asset to our offense The drive started on the Washington 28yard line where running back Samaje Perine filling in for an injured Rob Kelley rushed for nine and then three yards on consecutive plays to pick up a first down Cousins dropped back and found wide receiver Ryan Grant for 11 yards near the sideline and the back and forth air and ground game continued Perine rushed for eight yards then Cousins rolled to his right and found wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr by the sideline for 12 more The Redskins collected several more short yardage plays including a twoyard pass to Davis and a sixyard pass to wide receiver Jamison Crowder on a slant route to convert on third down After the first negative passing play of the drive to Crowder Cousins dropped back and found Davis showing off his speed to beat the corner in front of him Davis celebrated with his signature jump shot now a legal move and put the ball through the goal posts and into the stands It was one of those plays that we run in practice Davis said They called it I made the proper moves that I was supposed to make just looked up for the ball and it was there',\n",

       " 'Heres five takeaways from the Washington Redskins Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders that took place at FedExField in Landover Md 1 In a complete performance on national television the Redskins dominated the Raiders Despite Oakland entering FedExField with a 20 record and being considered one of the best teams in the NFL it was Washington who put on a complete showing Sunday evening From the getgo Washington controlled Oakland On just the second play from the line of scrimmage the Redskins intercepted a Derek Carr pass Eight plays after the Montae Nicholson pick the Redskins would score a 22yard touchdown between Kirk Cousins and Chris Thompson It laid the foundation for a onesided affair throughout the evening Cousins would finish the night 25of30 for 365 yards and three touchdowns Thompson continued his strong start to the year with 150 receiving yards and the defense allowed just 128 yards fewest surrendered since the 1992 season I think it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody to hold that offense with Marshawn Lynch and Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper the list goes on and on said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden 0for11 on third downs I mean its a great tribute to Coach Greg Manusky and the staff but the players were executing Hustling Making sure of tackles and getting the ball out when they had to In total the Redskins outgained the Raiders 472128 yards The 344yard differential was the largest in regular season action for Washington since Dec 15 1974 a span of 660 regular season games The fact that it was a full four quarter performance I felt that was outstanding Cousins said All offseason I was asked What are you working on what are you trying to get better at The answer was situational awareness Not just stick to my reads but to think about how does that read change every now and then because the game situation is changing I think Jay Gruden was talking about that looking at last year to now By knowing how to manage situations and making decisions based on what I am coached to do and then how the game is being played 2 The country got to see Chris Thompsons breakout campaign continue Even before Sunday game against the Raiders Thompson was one of the leagues best performers through the first two weeks of the season He had the beautiful touchdown reception in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and then followed it up with two scores against the Los Angeles Rams But Thompsons best game on the young season came against the Raiders as the fourthyear running back logged six receptions for 150 yards and a touchdown It was the most receiving yards in a game by any Redskins running back in records available dating back to 1960 surpassing the 140 receiving yards by running back Dick James on Dec 16 1962 His 188 yards from scrimmage were also the most by any member of the Redskins since Alfred Morris 200yard performance against the Dallas Cowboys Week 17 of the 2012 season I cant explain it said Thompson with a smile when asked about his performance Everybody all around just did a good job for me I got a lot of good looks Our offensive line did such a great job Kirk also he did such a great job just finding me Coach Gruden I think he deserves all of the credit for the offense I think he just called the perfect plays at the right time My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing It was such a great job by him I cant really take a lot of the credit Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays Thompsons best play of his 28 offensive snaps came in the third quarter when he turned a screen pass on 3 rd and19 into a 74yard gain Benefitting from great blocking out of the entire offensive line and Terrelle Pryor Sr Thompson raced down the sideline to not only prevent Oakland from getting the ball back but setting up a Dustin Hopkins field goal Hes a great player man Gruden said Now we have to keep him healthy and hes in a great role where hes at Hes going to be very effective working in third downs a lot were in second down and long a lot He will be utilized in those roles quite frequently 3 The defense heard all about the Raiders offense but quickly put an end to the hoopla surrounding Oaklands unit The defense hadnt had a performance like this in years Not only were the 128 total yards surrendered the teams fewest in 25 seasons Washington held Oakland to just 32 rushing yards fewest since the 2014 season and 96 net passing yards fewest since the 2008 season Despite Oaklands smash mouth style of play it was Washington who set the tempo Marshawn Lynch was bottled up any time he touched the ball and the defense flustered Carr into his first multiinterception game since the 2015 season The defense also sacked him four times We just plan on being physical every game said Jonathan Allen who recorded his first NFL sack off Carr I feel like that is something we want to build as an identity here I feel like we did a good job of doing that You have to give a lot of credit to Jim Tomsula and Greg Manusky coming up with a great game plan and DBs helped us a lot by covering them so we actually have time to get back there and we stopped the run Washingtons defense was at its best on third downs an area theyve struggled with in recent years Oakland had 11 third down attempts They wouldnt convert a single one Our goal was to stop the run and then get off on third down Nicholson said That is pretty much our goal every week I think we did that pretty well Like I said they have a great offense Even to do that it is just a step in the right direction for us Next up is Kansas City so we will go in and just go to work again Thats all we can do 4 Josh Doctson finally struck with a highlight reel touchdown catch In his most extensive NFL action to date Doctson finally found the end zone on one of the best catches during Sundays action After being targeted earlier on the third quarter drive one in which Doctson would drop the ball with David Amerson all over his back the 2016 firstround pick shook off the play to sky over the former Washington cornerback for a 52yard touchdown Despite Cousins slightly underthrowing the deep bomb Doctson adjusted to sky over Amerson and haul the ball in before trotting into the end zone for his first career touchdown It actually came out of the fake trying to throw it to Terrelle and I think Terrelle did end up winning late but I felt 38 TJ Carrie I believe was covering Terrelle was getting out of there and I felt like he was taking away the go ball and if Terrelle did end up getting by him it just shows how fast he really is Cousins said Then I looked back over to Josh and Davis Amerson was getting deep as well but I do like Joshs ball skills and his ability to catch the ball up in the air and I thought you know what Im going to give him a chance they have been asking me to give him that chance and lets give it to him It was scary when it left my hand because I still see David Amerson going up hes got the ball skills too and Josh made me right but that play can go either way you know Thats why this game is so tough Gruden said it was great to see Doctson finish the play with such ease after having a rough start to his time in Washington due to various injuries I think the players have seen him do that in practice quite often but nobody else has Gruden said You guys dont even get a chance to see it very often so it was good to get Kirk get the ball out of his hands and it wasnt a perfectly thrown ball but to give him a chance where he can go up and make a big time catch hopefully well get more of that But it was great to see man Im happy for Josh and happy that Kirk threw it 5 For the second straight Sunday Night Football game at FedExField the Redskins put on a show While the Redskins have struggled at times in nationally televised games two of Washingtons best performances over the last two years have come on Sunday Night Football Last November the Redskins powered past the Packers for a 4224 victory before silencing the Raiders Sunday with a 2710 victory in a contest that was more lopsided than the final score It marks the first time the Redskins have won backtoback appearances on Sunday Night Football while pushing the teams alltime record on the broadcast package to 18171 Although the game pushed the Redskins season record to 21 players and coaches alike downplayed the significance of the performance Its big but it is not at the same time Nicholson said That sounds weird but its big because like you said it is Sunday Night Football It is primetime Like I said they have a great offense but it isnt at the same time because its our third game Its still early in the season There is still a lot to build on still a lot of corrections to make but like I said it is early in the season I think we will get it together towards the end Gruden added that he didnt care if it was prime time or 1 oclock or midnight He just wanted his team to defend home turf once again We had lost the last two or three at home which was disappointing so to get one at home have it on prime time against a big time team like the Raiders that was satisfying But now we just have to celebrate it for a little bit and then get ready for a tough one Monday night at Arrowhead Stadium',\n",

       " 'After a couple of playerheld meetings earlier in the week the Redskins defense broke out in major fashion Sunday night against the Raiders with an historical performance in front of a national audience The disrespect festered and lay heavy on the defenses minds throughout the week Safety DJ Swearinger saw it as an opportunity He called a meeting on Tuesday to challenge everyone for the practice week ahead then held another Thursday at cornerback Josh Norman s house to hammer home the message Swearinger called these gatherings get right meetings a sobriquet meant to take the noise from the week an opponent predicting his offensive numbers and analysts betting against them and channel it into a dominating performance to show a national audience why it was so wrong to make assumptions without accounting for this newlook unit From the opening drive the enhanced focus was on full display and the Redskins defense marked by a physical abandon and determination unseen in years past turned an otherwise potent Raiders offensive attack into an insecure and feeble one Washingtons 2710 victory signified many things but none were more noticeable than what the defense achieved what it felt it needed to prove under the lights Sunday night We wanted to change the culture around from the defense from last year to this year I think we made a statement to the world today Swearinger said We got to keep building Its only one game but a great game a hell of a game by our defense by our team to get the team win and we can keep building on this The unquestionable vocal leader of the defense Swearinger heard his message reverberate on the first pass play when rookie Montae Nicholson made an acrobatic interception the first of his career against quarterback Derek Carr The momentum only enhanced from there The defense applied consistent pressure all night without much reinforcement sacking Carr four times and hitting running back Marshawn Lynch early and often One of those hits on Lynch belonged to Swearinger who stood by his locker after the game dressed in a Sean Taylor jersey and donning a Redskins Mexican straw hat calling the violent tackle an ode to his legacy I told the boys all week I said yall going to love it when I catch 24 Lynch Swearinger said I was tired of hearing Beast Mode the dancing all of that I said Im going to catch him I will catch him this game and Im so happy I got to catch him I played him my rookie year and I never got to tackle him my rookie year he retired I tip my hat to Beast Mode I played running back he was my favorite running back growing up But when I got to this level and I wanted to play against him it was more of a enemy So I was happy I got a lick on him today It wasnt just Swearinger laying out the hits Nicholson punished wide receiver Michael Crabtree with a forceful collision to the chest late in the game after the receiver couldnt catch a deep pass in midair Linebacker Zach Brown sped over and flattened anyone in his way slamming them to the ground and the defensive line led by outside linebackers Ryan Kerrigan and Preston Smith shed blocks with ease In total the Redskins limited the Raiders to 128 total yards the lowest total during head coach Jay Grudens tenure in Washington and the fewest yards allowed by the Redskins since Oct 12 1992 against Denver They also held the Raiders 0for11 on third downs the first time the Redskins have held an opponent without a third down conversion in 10 years Guys were hungry Smith said Guys were trying to hunt thats what our coach says Go out there and hunt We got to get to the quarterback with four guys we shouldnt have to blitz and there wasnt many blitzes called I dont think there was any called and we got inaudible with our four guys up front The defense forced two more turnovers in the game cornerback Kendall Fuller got his first career interception against Carr who threw for just 118 yards and then forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that linebacker Martrell Spaight scooped before running out of bounds and it was clear each unit impacted the next Plastering receivers for four quarters cornerback Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland worked in tandem to limit the Raiders biggest threats Michael Crabtree and Amari Cooper to just two total receptions for 13 yards For Norman it was poetic justice and the cornerback didnt mince his words about their performances I mean first and foremost you dont come in here and say what you are going to put up on somebody Norman said Twohundred yards He didnt even catch two balls Oh he only caught one So please whatever you do do not run your mouth to your wide receiver and respect to show up on Sundays Because I am telling you we are here and we are waiting Dont come out here and telling me what youre going to do Show me Youll have to run through me to get that And we aint letting that happen So whatever that young cat said cool youre going to take it back The complete game was enough for Gruden to say it was as good a defensive performance that Ive seen in a long time by anybody Under a new defensive coordinator and with personnel that continues to show its speed intelligence and physicality the Redskins defense made a statement it hopes will continue to grow in the weeks to come We wanted to send a message to the world and were not pushovers were not going to lay down for nobody we are going to compete every time were on the field Swearinger said This defense is definitely going to be stingy every time we are on the field and we are going to keep it rolling We got to keep it rolling we got a big game Monday night next week and we can get better from this week Well watch it on Tuesday and get better and well try to be better on Monday',\n",

       " 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Jay Gruden and Greg Manuskys press conferences at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Josh Doctson s catch against the Raiders indicated the progress hes made practicing on a consistent basis It was a welcome sight Last years firstround draft pick Josh Doctson leapt over cornerback David Amerson and collected a jump ball from Kirk Cousins rolling his way into the end zone for a 52yard score and his first catch of the season The connection offered hope for many fans eager to see the talent they had been promised which was sidelined for the majority of last season and this preseason The catch on Sunday night Gruden said will help to establish more trust between the pairing as will another week of consistent practice with the full squad We have seen that in practice Gruden said of hi acrobatic skills It was good to see it in a game finally Now it is a matter of continuing to work on his route tree We know he can run a goball now we have got to work on his other stuff and the timing He has shown that he can do everything I think it is just a matter of putting day after day together and game after game together He is on the right track without a doubt We are excited to get him more reps and more balls 2 DJ Swearinger brings attitude and leadership to a defense that played one of its best games in history last week Of the many offseason moves and roster changes the Redskins have undergone none might be as important as the signing of safety DJ Swearinger who has seamlessly taken over as the teams vocal leader and defensive captain Hes just a fiery guy a guy that knows football across the board and I love that Manusky said I love his spirit and he gets guys around him to rally behind him and hes taking us where we need to be Were not there right now but were getting there His natural ability to lead a diverse group of players has paid dividends on the field operating as the eyes and ears of the defense and translating his intelligence to the whole unit In fact hes made it a priority to host two defensive meetings each week for the entire unit going over game plans and helping every level understand how the other will be functioning Its gone a long way so far Its one thing being a vocal guy but you have to back it up with production and sound play and know what you are talking about Gruden said Ive had guys before that are talkers that dont know what they are doing but he brings both He brings an edge to him that rubs off on people Not to say we didnt have that before but it is just an added dimension with him being here He also has a great knowledge of our system already and he can communicate that well with the other safeties young safeties the linebackers and what have you and the corners Communication is key on defense 3 The defense must swarm to Kareem Hunt to limit his production this Monday An immoveable object will meet an unstoppable force this Monday night or something close to that The Redskins defense is allowing just 623 rushing yards per game good for second best in the league while the Chiefs boast rookie running back Kareem Hunt who leads the league in rushing yards with 401 and scrimmage yards with 538 I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times You know No 10 Tyreek Hill in the backfield and No 13 DeAnthony Thomas in the backfield two fast guys that can really split you down the middle and also running the ball They are two effective guys that can run to the edge The challenge for the Redskins will also be staying on their keys and not getting duped on misdirection and deceptive formations the Chiefs like to show I think he has great vision number one Gruden said of Hunt I mentioned the contact balance that he has and obviously he has got the speed to run through holes He has done very good They have a great scheme over there They keep you offbalance They have got the zone reads going They have got the jet sweeps They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football 4 The defensive unit is starting to gel with increased time playing together With so many new parts needing to sync together its been an impressive beginning to the season for the Redskins defense which has in consecutive weeks limited opponents run games and played the brand of aggressive football fans have waited to see for some time Gruden noted that aiding this transition of new parts including Swearinger linebacker Zach Brown and defensive linemen Stacy McGee and Terrell McClain is the experience they all brought with them These guys have played a lot of football Gruden said It is just a matter of getting together with the terminology and playing well with your teammates What drew us to those guys Jonathan Allen obviously was their work ethic how hard they played They all seemed like smart guys and they fit in well Manusky has seen steady improvement the more they have played in games together expecting their unity to grow over the coming weeks Its great to get a lot of reps of seeing these guys playing together Manusky said Sometimes when youre coming out of the preseason and stuff some guys get 10 reps 15 reps or 20 reps its hard to get a good judge on what they can do and what they cant do Overall weve been pretty successful in the last couple of weeks From the players perspective theyre doing a good job I think theyre building camaraderie amongst themselves and were playing together and good things happen 5 Injured players are on the mend Washington received a handful of injuries following the Rams game that prevented a few starters from playing against Oakland After an extra day of rest this week everyone but for tackle Ty Nsekhe who received core muscle surgery on Tuesday was back at practice and there is more optimism surrounding many of their returns While limited in practice Thursday running back Rob Kelly tight end Jordan Reed and linebacker Mason Foster all participated in individual drills Gruden isnt exactly sure the prognosis for them yet but their practicing is a positive sign We will see Gruden said when it came to Reed He felt better today did more team stuff today But we will have to wait and see So I dont know Gruden did also mention that defensive lineman Matt Ioannidis sustained a rotator cuff injury during the Raiders game Gruden is confident he should be able to play on Monday but Anthony Lanier II will be ready if needed',\n",

when the Redskins win KEEP DOCTSON IN THE LOOP For most starting wide receivers in the NFL having just one catch through three games isnt necessarily something to write home about But for Redskins wide receiver Josh Doctson his one catch a 52yard touchdown reception against the Oakland Raiders could be the start of a new chapter for the 2016 firstround pick After a rookie season almost completely wiped away by different Achilles injuries Doctson has been active for Washingtons first three games of the season Despite his health the TCU product wasnt targeted in the season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles and was located just once by quarterback Kirk Cousins against the Los Angeles Rams His touchdown reception one in which he timed a jump perfectly over Raiders cornerback David Amerson proved what hes capable of though We have seen that in practice said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden of Doctsons catch It was good to see it in a game finally Now it is a matter of continuing to work on his route tree We know he can run a goball now we have got to work on his other stuff and the timing He has shown that he can do everything I think it is just a matter of putting day after day together and game after game together He is on the right track without a doubt We are excited to get him more reps and more balls Doctsons presence could be the difference against Kansas Citys defense especially if Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters is being matched up with fellow Redskins wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr Hes been so confident said Redskins cornerback Josh Norman His approach to the game and practices he makes all those plays in practice that you all saw down on the field in the game For us we see it in the game its like You do it out here in practice and lo and behold his time came and his shot was there He made the most of it To see him capture that moment and come in here like that I know it was a big big sigh of relief for him with those things off his shoulders Now we actually see that come to fruition what he put in practice and its a beautiful thing to see Everybody was rooting for him and Im glad that he could come in and make a play like that for the team Stephen Czarda HUNT DOWN KAREEM Chiefs running back Kareem Hunt was virtually a noname heading into Week 1 After losing original starter Spencer Ware before the opening game against the New England Patriots the Chiefs called upon their thirdround pick Hunt fumbled his first handoff but made few errors from then on Now Hunt is playing like a veteran in his prime Hes the leagues leading rusher through three games with 401 yards 113 more than his secondplace competitor Dalvin Cook He has yet to fumble since Week 1 and has not averaged below five yards a carry in any of his games He also has at least one run of 50 or more yards in every game this season and has scored at least one touchdown in each contest I think hes a great back hes been doing a great job this year defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said Weve got to get a lot of hats around him make sure that we tackle him He can break tackles seen him do that many a times Hunt also provides an added dimension to Kansas Citys already explosive offense With so much productivity in the ground game Chiefs head coach Andy Reid can open up the passing game for quarterback Alex Smith Gruden said these different offensive schemes can put a defense on its heels They have a lot of things that you dont see every day in pro football Gruden said Coach Reid does an excellent job with his offense and disguising his intent using a lot of different guys to touch the ball a lot of skill Washington will have to rely on its defensive playmakers like cornerback Josh Norman and linebacker Zach Brown to try and bottle up Hunt before he breaks off another 50yard run With linebacker Mason Foster still nursing an injury Hunt may look to the middle of the field for his next big play Brandon Hill COOLING OFF ALEX SMITH Alex Smith was drafted No 1overall by San Francisco in 2005 and has since endured a lengthy career in the NFL starting 75 games for the 49ers before his arrival in Kansas City more than four years ago Despite the vast experience he boasts Smith might be playing better now than he ever has in his career As it stands heading into Week 4 the 33yearold tops the league in passer rating completion percentage and game winning drives among other categories He has generally played mistakefree football as well passing for seven touchdowns and no interceptions He has done this all while leading the NFLs thirdbest offense in terms of yards per game While much of the national attention has been paid to Hunt and explosive wide receiver Tyreek Hill Smith is a big reason why the Chiefs have jumped out to a 30 record Despite the changes hes seen in efficiency and production lately he has stuck to one tactic that has helped him throughout his NFL career staying mobile He is one of those guys that can avoid trouble and hurt you with his legs Gruden said of Smith You can have everybody covered downfield but he can rush for the first downs on thirdandeight thirdand10 whatever it is Smiths hot start will be put to the test on Monday night however as he goes up against a Redskins defense that is coming off a fantastic performance against the Raiders The unit was able to force four sacks two fumbles and two interceptions Jay Cannon SHOW EM SUNDAY WAS NO FLUKE Redskins safety DJ Swearinger took all of the talk about the Raiders last week personally Yes Oakland was entering the game with a 20 record and fresh off a 124 season last year But almost no one outside of the Redskins was giving the team much of a chance Then the game happened and it was a onesided blowout courtesy of a dominating defensive performance Washington hadnt experienced in 25 years When I had the meeting on Tuesday I said nobodys going to give us a chance to win Swearinger said following the 2710 victory The NFL wants the Oakland Raiders to come in Washington and beat up on the Washington Redskins and as a defense were not going to let that happen Regardless of what the offense and special teams do we control the game if they dont score they dont win and whichever the offense how many yards they put up tonight rushing yards passing yards I mean I think our defense stood up and really made a statement on the No 1 offense in the league While it was an impressive outing this weeks matchup may be even tougher Not only are the Chiefs one of just two remaining unbeaten teams the Redskins have to play in Arrowhead Stadium The Redskins will be seeking backtoback road victories on Monday Night Football for the first time since 2005 and 2007 while pushing their prime time record this year to 20 You can never really get too comfortable Foster said Its the NFL everybody gets paid everybodys a playmaker so any game on a national stage like this against a great coach and a great offense is a big game So youve got to approach it like that Stephen Czarda',\n",

       " 'When the Redskins signed linebacker Zach Brown in the offseason one of his first promises to the secondary was that it wouldnt need to worry about tackling So far thats been the case When head coach Jay Gruden thinks of linebacker Zach Brown one play comes to mind that exemplifies the impact hes had on the Redskins through three games Early in the second quarter during the teams victory over the Rams quarterback Jared Goff found tight end Gerald Everett wide open down the right sideline and a 75yard touchdown looked inevitable But sprinting at full capacity and catching up to him was Brown who made a tackle just six yards before the goal line His speed shows up a lot Gruden said Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in gameday when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed But that play was also indicative of a promise that Brown made to his defensive backs when he was signed in the offseason Second in the league in tackles last season 149 and second again entering Week 4 with 33 Browns biggest attribute has been bringing players to the ground letting his corners and safeties focus primarily on coverage duties On that neartouchdown catch Brown knew that safety Deshazor Everett could have also tackled the Rams tight end before the goal line but wanted to clean up the mess himself In my mind I want to protect my corners and the secondary Brown said I dont want nobody picking on them nobody trying to make dumb tackles Were going to tackle were going to defeat the block that you got coming for us and were going to go get them Me and Mason Foster and the front seven will make sure you dont have to tackle no running back he added A lot of people get hurt tackling a running back Its one of the many reasons why cornerback Josh Norman smiling at his recent locker room session with the media said of Brown he makes the job a whole lot easier and then summed up his thoughts Boy I love Zach Brown Someone else sharing that sentiment and reaping the rewards of Browns tackling abilities is cornerback Bashaud Breeland who sits next to Brown in the locker room and likes to share conversation about their nearby hometowns in South Carolina Hes already noticed a difference in Browns speed letting him play observer to opposing running backs being tackled Through three games Breeland has just eight tackles After two games last season before he injured himself early against the Giants Breeland had already collected 19 tackles Last year around this time I probably had around 20some tackles Breeland said Now I really dont have to worry about the tackling If I do he kind of beats me to him or he assists me Hes all of over the field Thats a great addition to the team Hes making it easy for us While safety DJ Swearinger has already been anointed the vocal leader of the defense Brown has earned a similar leadership role for his play on the field and during times of crisis Take last Sundays game against the Raiders for example when defensive coordinator Greg Manuskys communication system failed during several plays Brown stepped in to make the calls without it They made a call and they played it Manusky said So whatever the call was that Zach Brown made in the middle we played it It was an indication of the trust players have in Brown as well as the inside linebackers intelligence and readiness to step up when needed If youre the other linebacker on the field youre going to know the calls you have to know the calls make sure you know where everybodys supposed to be because you never know Brown said When Mason Foster went down I had to call the calls so you just have to know Because somebody might not know what theyre supposed to do so youve got to tell them youve got to be able to communicate with them on defense and its trust too They trust me to make the call Brown has garnered that trust by doing the little things he said showing up on time to meetings correcting mistakes on the field and communicating constantly about miscues that can be fastened up Browns goal one he stated during OTAs is to be the defensive MVP this season an award often given to those with high tackle totals But individual statistics can sometimes be misleading as Brown hopes them to be for the remainder of the season Good defenses get around 55 plays so if you get around 55 plays youre not going to have as many tackles Brown said But your defense is going to be that good So for us as a defense were trying to cut down our plays because the more you cut down your pays the more youre off the field So thats a big goal of ours Still the tackles he does acquire will continue to make a difference keeping the secondary out of harms way as the Redskins keep building on their defensive cohesiveness',\n",

and punt On the punt Quinton Dunbar was removed from the game With Norman also already sidelined the Redskins looked to rookie Fabian Moreau opposite Bashaud Breeland at cornerback Kansas City would march all the way down to Washingtons 14yard line before the Chiefs rookie kicker converted a 32yard attempt with less than five minutes left in the quarter The ensuing Redskins drive would start with a first down reception by Terrelle Pryor Sr before Chris Thompson tallied a twoyard gain On 3 rd and8 from the Washington 43yard line Kirk Cousins would scramble to his right to pick up a new set of downs The Redskins went back to Thompson on another first down run which once again went for two yards before Cousins once again picked up a first down with his legs before the twominute warning On the first play after the break Cousins once again tucked it and ran for an eightyard gain before Thompson was stuffed on a second down carry With a little more than a minute left in the frame Cousins tried to hit Josh Doctson for a gamewinning touchdown but the receiver didnt complete posession of the ball Dustin Hopkins however would tie the game on a 40yard attempt With 47 seconds left in the quarter Kansas Citys offense got the ball back and would drive into Washington territory before the Redskins used their second timeout Harrison Butker came on for a 43yard field goal which he would make with four seconds left in the game Washington would try some magic on the final play of the game but it would result in a fumble recovered for touchdown with no time left Third Quarter Redskins 17 Chiefs 17 With the opening of the second half Redskins cornerback Josh Norman rib was downgraded to out while running back Rob Kelley s ankle return is doubtful The Chiefs would take advantage of multiple Redskins penalties on the first drive of the third quarter one that would end with an Alex Smith oneyard touchdown run It looked like Washington was going to get off the field after a third down stop inside the fiveyard line but Preston Smith was called for offsides to give Kansas City one more chance to strike The Redskins responded quickly though driving 75 yards in just three plays before Ryan Grant scored his second touchdown of the season On the first play of the drive tight end Vernon Davis caught the ball before weaving in and out of the Chiefs defense for a 69yard gain He is now 10 th alltime in NFL history in receiving yards among tight ends On the defenses next outing DJ Swearinger and Ziggy Hood linked up for a sack but the Chiefs would tie the game just before the end of the quarter on a made 26yard field goal attempt by Kansas City rookie kicker Harrison Butker Second Quarter Redskins 10 Chiefs 7 The Chiefs looked primed to finally put points on the board early in the second quarter even if it was just a field goal but a sack by Matt Ioannidis on 3 rd and7 from the 31yard line pushed Kansas City out of scoring range After the Chiefs punt went into the end zone for a touchback the Redskins were able to get into Chiefs territory but were unable to extend their lead On the drive running back Rob Kelley was deemed questionable to return with an ankle injury while tackle Trent Williams is dealing with a knee injury His return is also questionable On the Chiefs next drive the defense continued to hold strong Cornerbacks Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland laid backtoback big hits on Kansas Citys skill players but a flag on Breeland on a third down play that was originally an Alex Smith incompletion kept the drive alive Despite the extra set of downs Washington didnt allow Kansas City to sniff scoring range The offenses response would last just three plays though as Kansas City forced their first threeandout on the night The Chiefs took advantage scoring their first touchdown of the night on a Travis Kelce 17yard reception Washington would go into the twominute offense after the touchdown Quarterback Kirk Cousins quickly completed a 13yard pass to Ryan Grant before going to Jordan Reed on backtoback throws On 3rdand3 though Cousins was unable to locate the Pro Bowl tight end for a third time as Tress Way came out to punt with 111 left in the half Kansas City would move the chains off a 32yard scramble by Smith and get into Washington territory with 25 seconds left in the frame The quarterback would then complete another pass to Kelce that put the Chiefs into field goal territory New kicker Harrison Butker would miss his first ever regular season attempt though First Quarter Redskins 10 Chiefs 0 The Redskins struck quickly against the Chiefs in Monday nights game as the Washington often drove 75 yards in just six plays to score a touchdown On the scoring play quarterback Kirk Cousins dropped back to hit Terrelle Pryor

fourth sack in as many games on the units first appearance of the contest Their debut on the night ended in a threeandout The offenses second drive went through Chris Thompson to start as the running back gained 12 yards on two carries before Cousins moved the chains on 4 th and1 picking up five yards on a keeper Washington would work the ball down to inside the 10yard line off a Jordan Reed

battle in time of possession the Redskins showed resiliency against the Chiefs Entering Monday nights game as the only remaining unbeaten in the NFL and playing in front of their own fans the Chiefs were considered favorites to score a victory But in the opening frame it was the Redskins who looked ready to seize a big victory The offenses first drive was capped by a 44yard touchdown connection between Kirk Cousins and Terrelle Pryor Sr while the defense forced a threeandout Washington would eventually climb out to a 100 lead before the Chiefs stormed back in the second half as they got the best of a Redskins defense that was wounded They also dominated time of possession keeping the ball in their hands for more than 37 minutes I feel like its a hard fought game at a great stadium great atmosphere it was crazy man we just got to make more plays so we win said linebacker Mason Foster Thats what it comes down to While the effort showed that Washington has the depth to compete with any team in the NFL losing such a close battle is tough Im an ultimate competitor but I feel like this game shows a lot about this team that we got a pretty darn good football team said cornerback Quinton Dunbar And it shows where were at and it shows that if we keep battling keep believing in each other keep believing in the coaches and the gameplan when we get back off this bye its going to be a special 12 weeks Despite falling in the closing seconds after the Chiefs nailed a field goal with eight seconds left Pryor believes the Redskins proved they are fighters We battled a team thats pretty darn good on paper Pryor said When they came in here theyre 40 for a reason obviously We had a lot of opportunities We led in the game a long time then we came back and punched them after they hit us back in the mouth and we punched them back We just needed to score a touchdown A field goal doesnt win games Touchdowns do Its unfortunate that we couldnt get that first down late in the red zone and that was the last time we saw the ball really 2 Headlined by Josh Norman s rib injury the defense had to go deep into their rotations against one of the leagues most explosive offenses Norman did not play at all in the second half of Mondays 2920 loss to the Chiefs as the cornerback suffered a rib injury that could sideline him for some time But the former AllPro wasnt the only defensive player that needed attention from the teams training staff as Dubar safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett and even Foster missed some plays in a second half in which Kansas City controlled the ball a majority of the time For Norman his loss was especially difficult on the defense as he was setting a tempo against Kansas Citys offense On one play prior to his exit Norman laid a big hit on Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce I came in and got Xrays and saw one of my ribs had something done to it Norman said I wanted to come back out but the team specialist thought it was best if I stay out I said I was but its a long season We just want to be cautious With the defense wanting to be more physical this season Foster admitted that sometimes players are going to get a little banged up But the younger players provided a glimpse of their potential while instilling trust that they can match the starters intensity on the field When youve got guys on this defense playing as hard as they do flying around playing special teams playing their heart out every single snap you are going to see guys get hurt and nicked up Foster said But thats why the other guys practice I mean everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how defensive coordinator Greg Manusky coaches it so everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 3 Kirk Cousins continued his string of solid performances in front of a national stage In Washingtons season opening loss to Philadelphia Cousins fumbled twice including one that sealed the Redskins fate along with throwing an untimely fourth quarter interception in the red zone But in recent weeks the Michigan State product has bounced back While Monday wasnt his most prolific game Cousins played mistakefree football He finished the night completing 14of24 passes for 220 yards and two touchdowns He also registered a passer rating of 1167 I think in this league the 16week season is a grind and its not for the faint of heart Cousins said Youve got to be physically emotionally and mentally tough Nobody feels sorry for you if you arent You just try to stay the course and be really toughminded and whatever gets thrown at you just take it in stride Cousins was also able to showcase his mobility particularly on a late gametying field goal drive While the Chiefs were unable to sack the quarterback on the night they did flush him out of the pocket a few times Cousins however took advantage of some open running lanes as he carried the ball three different times for 33 yards When teams play man coverage thats when you really have an opportunity to run because guys are chasing their man and they dont have eyes on you Cousins said They did a good job of taking guys away and doubling some people and really all I had was to run and I think thats an area of my game that I can use more I think Its there for the taking if I get through a progression and dont find anything and take off and run instead of throw it away Cousins also came close to throwing a gamewinning touchdown on the drive as he lofted a beautiful ball to wide receiver Josh Doctson but the pair was unable to connect for a touchdown in consecutive weeks We just didnt hit that third down play Cousins said Well go back and look at a couple of other plays throughout the game that couldve made a big difference but allinall we played well I was pleased there were so few penalties on offense We played pretty mistakefree I think in a lot of ways showed some maturity from that standpoint Tough one to lose It felt like we had a chance there and didnt get it done 4 Vernon Davis continues to show that he has a lot left in the tanks One of the reasons why the Redskins had just four offensive plays in the third quarter was due to a 69yard reception by Davis After the Chiefs jumped out to their first lead of the game at 1410 midway through the third quarter Cousins found Davis open on the right side of the field While the initial reception would have easily netted the Redskins a new set of downs Davis continued to defy Father Time as the 33yearold tight end weaved in and out of the Chiefs defense for the nearly 70plusyard gain Not only was the reception Davis longest since a 73yard catch on Jan 3 2010 it moved him into the top 10 alltime in NFL history in receiving yards among tight ends Davis now has eight catches for 120 yards in the last three games We call him el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Cousins said We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 5 The bye week comes at the perfect time With the Redskins battling injuries on both sides of the ball the players will extra time to heal their wounds before returning to game action on Sunday Oct 15 against the San Francisco 49ers at FedExField in Landover Md We get a chance to rest get some treatment and really ice up and get ready to make a big run said Foster who suffered a dislocated shoulder in Week 2 against the Los Angeles Rams So I think its perfect timing we know what were capable of so we got to get it corrected and focus on that and then come back and just let it get on a roll try to tag them together so its coming at the perfect time Norman agreed with Foster as the cornerback hopes to not miss any time with his rib injury A lot of us are banged up right now Norman said Were going to go back and lick our wounds come back out here in a week and try to get a W We came out here for it so its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that',\n",
       " 'This weeks Redskins Drive of the Game presented by Ford was a threeplay 75yard scoring drive finished off by a Ryan Grant threeyard touchdown catch that gave the Redskins the lead After a 10play 79yard scoring drive by the Kansas City Chiefs to open up the second half one that would put them ahead for the first time of the night the Redskins responded rapidly with a big pass play Starting from their own 25yard line the Redskins helped quiet a crowd that had gained momentum with the help of tight end Vernon Davis who caught a 69yard pass that came about largely because of his speed and patience Quarterback Kirk Cousins threw a perfect pass to Davis open down the right seam and then the tight end began using his vision waiting for blocks ahead of him to scamper around cutting to his left and running down to the Kansas City sixyard line The pass play put Davis in 10th alltime in receiving yards among tight ends in NFL history We call him el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Cousins said of Davis We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19 year old Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with Running back Samaje Perine carried the ball up the middle for three yards and then the Redskins made it count Cousins found wide receiver Ryan Grant on a shallow crossing route in the end zone with Grant making an impressive grab It was his second touchdown of the season snagging it above cornerback Marcus Peters and giving Washington the lead back just like that The drive took just one minute and 38 seconds',\n",

       " 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda provides five things weve learned about the Washington Redskins through the first four games Eagles Rams Raiders and Chiefs of the 2017 regular season 1 The defense is looking like a completely different unit this year One season after the Redskins finished 28 th in total defense the unit looks anew this season under Greg Manusky who was promoted to defensive coordinator in the offseason after spending the 2016 season as the teams outside linebackers coach Through the first four games of the season the Redskins rank 10 th in total defense allowing just a little more than 311 yards per contest Washington also ranks third in the NFL in total sacks 12 while allowing just 69 first downs Washingtons best defensive performance in 25 seasons came in a 2710 victory over the Oakland Raiders as the defense allowed just 128 yards the fewest yards allowed by Washington in a game since Oct 12 1992 They also didnt allow Oakland to convert on all 11 of their third down plays I think we played very strong in the middle of our defense said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Our defensive linemen did a great job being stout Our outside backers were stout in the running game and held them to minimal yards per carry and forced them to throw the ball in known passing situations enabled our rush to get home and our coverage was tight I think just all around the calls were sound the players executed we tackled extremely well we flew to the football didnt give up any big plays whatsoever other than the touchdown pass after the turnover I think when youre talking about a defense that played that well I think its impossible to just say This is why I think its because everybody who took part played well played hard played with great passion and energy and played smart This success is also coming with linebacker Trent Murphy and defensive lineman Phil Taylor both of whom were expected to be key rotational players sidelined for the year with injuries and the team having to quickly determine a new strong safety plan when Sua Cravens was placed on the ReserveLefft Squad list The units depth was tested against the Kansas City Chiefs as numerous players including cornerbacks Josh Norman and Quinton Dunbar along with safeties Montae Nicholson and Deshazor Everett were all sidelined for certain periods of time with injury Everybody can play on this team its not like a big dropoff everybody can play and thats how Manusky coaches it said linebacker Mason Foster who sealed Washingtons Week 2 victory over the Rams with a late interception So everybodys got to be ready and I think guys prepared throughout the week and they were ready when they came onto the field 2 Vernon Davis continues to be The Ageless One For most teams having their No 1 tight end limited would be troublesome But the Redskins arent like most teams in the NFL with the depth they have at the position With Jordan Reed has been slowed by various injuries so far this year Davis has stepped up in a big way for the offense After not being targeted in Washingtons Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles the 33yearold has caught eight passes for 160 yards 11 th most among tight ends and one touchdown His 20 yards per reception also leads all tight ends In the Redskins blowout victory over the Raiders Davis caught a 22yard touchdown pass in the second quarter Then against the Chiefs in Week 4 Davis caught two passes for 89 yards 69 of which came when Davis outran two defenders to initial catch the ball before weaving his way through traffic Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said Just out here at practice hes running around like a 20yearold kid Were going to have to try to dive into that but I know he has a great routine in the offseason during the season His diet is topnotch His workouts are on point Not to mention he prepares and hes just always got a smile on his face Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player Quarterback Kirk Cousins added that Davis has earned the nickname el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field We always talk about his hamstrings and how theyre like the hamstrings of a 19yearold Cousins said Special player but I keep going back to hes a great player but hes a better person Hes not a guy who acts entitled Hes a guy who could at his age and experience level He is just very humble hungry and is just a fun guy to play football with 3 New faces have led the way for the defensive unit One of the reasons why the Redskins have seen such positive early returns on the defensive side of the ball is because of some of the players that were brought in this offseason Yes Ryan Kerrigan and Josh Norman continue to play at a high level Matt Ioannidis also looks like a completely different player this year too But the likes of DJ Swearinger Zach Brown and Jonathan Allen have made a difference After an offseason competition for the starting inside linebacker spots Brown earned the nod to be the No 1 Mo linebacker and he hasnt disappointed The 2016 Pro Bowler currently tops the NFL in tackles with 42 I think his speed really shows up on tape Gruden said Plays that for instance the Rams game when the kid broke a long run the tight end who ran a 45 at the combine or whatever he ran he got hawked down by Zach Brown and what the heck did Zach Brown run then So his speed shows up a lot Pursuing to the football dropping in pass coverage planting his foot and coming and gang tackling and making plays so I think you dont really notice that on the practice field until you get in game day when you see it show up I think thats the biggest thing that hes added to this defense hes added to our team speed Swearinger meanwhile is a vocal presence in the defensive backfield But his presence goes well beyond the lines Hes recently hosted a playersonly Get Right meeting to focus on corrections I emphasize all the small things Sort of the small things that coaches dont cover that experience has to give you Swearinger said Thats what I try to give them Theyre growing Shazor Deshazor Everett hes doing great Montae Nicholson is doing great Those guys Im a young guy but I feel like Im an old guy with these young guys I feel like a proud big bro especially with Montae and Shazor but Im going to stay on those guys and theyre going to continue to get better As for Allen Washingtons firstround pick in this years draft has been productive in the trenches He continues to lead the defensive lines rotation as he grows with every passing week Thats the beauty thats the most exciting thing about Jonathan He just hasnt scratched the surface of his own potential yet Gruden said He is just going to get better and better the more he sees and the more he plays 4 Chris Thompson has been one of the leagues breakout players so far Entering the season Gruden remained committed in his belief that Thompson is one of the best thirddown backs in the NFL Then the Redskins remained committed in their belief that Thompson should remain in Washington for a few more years as they signed him to a contract extension before the regular season opener Through the first four weeks of the season the 2013 fifthround pick has recorded 20 carries for 142 yards and two touchdowns along with 14 receptions for 235 yards and two receiving touchdowns Thompson is just one rushing yard off from leading Washington in both rushing and receiving I think the temptation early on was Man hes a little smallish Can he hold up How much can you give him the ball how much can you play him He was a big part of special teams But then when hes on the field hes so productive in every phase of the game said Redskins offensive coordinator Matt Cavanaugh Hes a good runner very good runner Hes got great explosion Hes excellent in running routes and catching the ball and hes a very good pass protector Against the Eagles in the opener Thompson recorded the Redskins first touchdown of the season when he caught a short pass and flipped it into a 29yard touchdown off a magical play The next week he logged two more touchdowns against the Rams before accumulating 188 yards from scrimmage against the Raiders While theres certainly a temptation to get Thompson more and more reps Gruden wants to keep his role one that hes excelling in defined Ive said before hes a very valuable guy in the role that hes in third down Gruden said Hes also one of our kick returners He does a lot of getting back on track calls on second downandlong and theres some firstdown plays that hes in But yes its important for us to keep him healthy Hes not a guy that I personally want to give him 30 carries a game He probably wants it but he probably wont get it 5 After one of his worst outings in the opener Cousins is starting to round into form again It was a game in which the Pro Bowl quarterback didnt look himself Coming off a season in which he threw for nearly 5000 yards Cousins struggled against the Eagles in Week 1 He completed only 23of40 passes for 240 yards with one touchdown to one interception The interception was one of three turnovers from Cousins as the quarterback skied an errant pass on a crucial third down throw Then minutes later the quarterback was stripped sack as he was trying to mount a gamewinning drive But in the three games since the opener Cousins has been nearly flawless Along with leading a successful gamewinning drive against the Rams Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his efforts against the Raiders 25of35 for 365 yards with three touchdowns In total against the Rams Raiders and Chiefs Cousins is 57of81 for 764 yards with six touchdowns to no interceptions I think there is a lot to like really I think especially after the first game Gruden said He got a lot of pressure He was a little bit inaccurate the first game more so then he ever has been but a lot of that had to do with the pressure that Philly gave him People were in his face quite often I think he has improved dramatically Week 2 Week 3 and even against the Chiefs I was impressed that last drive He had a couple huge scrambles using his legs big runs to get us into a position to get a tying field goal or possibly win the game if Josh can hang on to the ball Kirk is playing well and he is getting us in position to win Thats all you can ask for at the end of the day I have been impressed with Kirk in the way he has come on after Week 1',\n",

       " 'Heres a look at the remaining games slated for the Redskins following the Week 5 bye Washington has yet to play two of their division rivals and will have two trips to the West Coast before the seasons end The Washington Redskins had a grueling first quarter of the season Pro Football Reference ranked Washingtons fourgame slate as the toughest in the NFL The Los Angeles Rams Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs all sit atop their divisions The only Redskins opponent not leading their division would be the Oakland Raiders who recently lost Derek Carr to a multipleweek injury Luckily for Washington the remaining 12 games on the schedule rank among the easiest in the league right now according to FootballOutsiderscom with many teams posting records below 500 four games into the season Heres a look at whats ahead for the Redskins for the rest of the regular season Week 6 San Francisco 49ers 04 4 th place in NFC West Top Passer Brian Hoyer 858 yards 2 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Carlos Hyde 321 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Pierre Garon 20 receptions 285 yards 0 touchdowns The 49ers seemed to have an immediate upgrade at receiver after acquiring former Redskins starter PierreGaron in the offseason However Garons numbers do not quite match up to last years This is not at all aided by quarterback Brian Hoyers high interception total and inability to score in the red zone The offense has been outscored 4914 through the air The defense is an area that has exceeded expectations San Francisco has the sixthhighest rate of quarterback pressures through four weeks Week 7 Philadelphia Eagles 31 1 st place in NFC East Top Passer Carson Wentz 1058 yards 6 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher LeGarrette Blount 249 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Zach Ertz 26 receptions 326 yards 1 touchdown Quarterback Carson Wentz has refined his game after a bumpy rookie campaign He already has a third of the passing yards he accumulated last year After defeating the Redskins at FedExField in Week 1 snapping a fivegame losing streak against Washington the Eagles will have the comfort of a home crowd in the battle for the NFC East crown Tight end Zach Ertz may lead the team in receiving yards but new addition Alshon Jeffery gives the Eagles a legitimate deep threat at receiver Jeffery has 215 yards on 17 catches this season with two touchdowns Week 8 Week 13 Dallas Cowboys 22 2 nd place in NFC East Top Passer Dak Prescott 941 yards 8 touchdowns 3 interceptions Top Rusher Ezekiel Elliott 277 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Dez Bryant 16 receptions 212 yards 2 touchdowns There has been plenty of drama on and off the field for the Dallas Cowboys Running back Ezekiel Elliot has broken 100 yards on the ground just once through four games and averages two yards fewer per carry compared to last year Meanwhile quarterback Dak Prescott who only had four interceptions in 2016 has nearly reached that mark through four games On defense the Cowboys have a gem in defensive end Demarcus Lawrence who leads the NFL in sacks with 75 Rookie linebacker Jaylon Smith has also been a force to reckon with recording a teamhigh 34 tackles The Cowboys were favorited by pundits to win the NFC East before the year began but so far have just one less loss than they did during the entire 2016 season Week 9 Seattle Seahawks 22 2 nd place in NFC West Top Passer Russell Wilson 1024 yards 7 touchdowns 2 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Carson 208 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Doug Baldwin 23 receptions 247 yards 1 touchdown Seattle knows how to win with just a few key elements strong defense and crafty playmaking from Russell Wilson Wilson the teams second leading rusher with 138 yards has been on the run for most of the season due to a shaky offensive line Eddy Lacy was brought in during the offseason to fill in as the groundandpound running back a spot previously occupied by Marshawn Lynch So far Lacy has been ineffective notching only 55 yards The Seahawks have outscored opponents 108 to 63 and held their last opponent the Indianapolis Colts to just three points in the second half of a big victory The Seattle defense has only allowed a team to score more than 18 just once this season Week 10 Minnesota Vikings 22 3 rd place in NFC North Top Passer Case Keenum 755 yards 3 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Dalvin Cook 354 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Stefon Diggs 22 receptions 391 yards 4 touchdowns The Vikings looked like the team to beat in the North after quarterback Sam Bradford led his team to a 2919 win over the New Orleans Saints in the regular season opener Unfortunately for Minnesota Bradford went down with a knee injury It looked like the Vikings would rely on the running game to carry the offense but rookie tailback Dalvin Cook tore his ACL while making a cut against the Detroit Lions in Week 4 Now the Vikings have relied but quarterback Case Keenum and receiver Stefon Diggs to help put points on the board which may still be the case by Week 10 when the Redskins host Minnesota at FedExField The defense remains the one constant for the team allowing an average of 19 points per game The team excels in creating interceptions totaling three on the season at times but has yet to force a fumble The run defense has also been impressive allowing just 285 yards on the ground through four games Week 11 New Orleans Saints 22 4 th place in NFC South Top Passer Drew Brees 1135 yards 8 touchdowns 0 interceptions Top Rusher Mark Ingram 170 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Michael Thomas 25 receptions 310 yards 2 touchdowns At 38 years old Drew Brees continues to defy his age Currently the leagues fourthleading passer Brees averages 2765 yards per game as he inches closer to the NFLs alltime passing record At running back Adrian Peterson seems to have taken a backseat in head coach Sean Paytons offense The 11year veteran has only 27 carries on the year for 81 yards The defense was the biggest concern for the Saints during their first three games New Orleans had the second highest yards allowed per game heading into Week 4 but quickly turned things around in London shutting out the Miami Dolphins By Week 11 it should be clear whether this defensive performance was a fluke or if serious improvement has been underway in the Big Easy Week 12 Week 17 New York Giants 04 4 th place in NFC East Top Passer Eli Manning 1113 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Paul Perkins 61 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Sterling Shephard 21 receptions 254 yards 1 touchdown The Giants 04 start might be the biggest surprise in the NFL Turnovers have played a large part in New Yorks journey to the bottom of the league Manning has thrown the ball to defenders four times while opposing quarterbacks have yet to throw a pick against the Giants defense The team brought in receiver Brandon Marshall during the offseason to compliment Odell Beckham Jr but neither wideout has played up to par Sterling Shephard however has burst onto the scene as the Giants leading receiver gaining 49 more yards than Beckham and 54 more yards than Marshall The Giants have also been seriously outgained on the ground Opponents have run for 571 yards against New Yorks defense while the Giants own backs have only managed 237 yards Washingtons last game of the season will be played at MetLife Stadium and the outcome may shape the final standings of the NFC East Week 14 Los Angeles Chargers 04 4 th place in AFC West Top Passer Philip Rivers 1107 yards 6 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher Melvin Gordon 168 yards 2 touchdowns Top Receiver Keenan Allen 24 receptions 334 yards 1 touchdown Facing two teams who started 04 may be the morale boost Washington needs heading into the final stretch of the season The recently relocated Chargers have had trouble maintaining consistency on defense Los Angeles ranks last in yards allowed after first contact with 26 and has been outgained on the ground 654 yards to 270 yards Meanwhile quarterback Philip Rivers has caught the interception bug not at all helped by the fact that he has been sacked six times this season This isnt to say the Chargers have been a pushover all season Excluding a 14point loss to the Chiefs the Chargers have been outscored by an average of 23 points Week 15 Arizona Cardinals 22 3 rd place in NFC West Top Passer Carson Palmer 1282 yards 5 touchdowns 5 interceptions Top Rusher Chris Johnson 93 yards 0 touchdowns Top Receiver Larry Fitzgerald 26 receptions 276 yards 2 touchdowns Its never good when a quarterbacks touchdowns and interceptions totals are equal and his sack total of 17 tops the NFL However Carson Palmer and the Arizona offense have found ways to win by the narrowest of margins The Cardinals never meant to lean on Palmers arm but a Week 1 injury to running back David Johnson severely limited Arizonas ground game The defense has created opportunities but has failed to capitalize forcing four fumbles but never recovering Three interceptions have led to better field position for the offense but if Arizona wants to hold its own against Washington Palmer will have to keep the ball away from Josh Norman and the rest of the Redskins secondary So far Washingtons secondary has done well in creating turnovers Week 16 Denver Broncos 31 2 nd place in AFC West Top Passer Trevor Siemian 888 yards 7 touchdowns 4 interceptions Top Rusher CJ Anderson 330 yards 1 touchdown Top Receiver Demaryius Thomas 18 receptions 247 yards 0 touchdowns After once again earning the starting role in the offseason quarterback Trevor Siemian has performed admirably through 2017 However his 13 sacks are tied for fifth highest in the league When the offensive line struggles in pass protection it exceeds expectations in creating running lanes CJ Anderson and the rest of the Denver running attack has outrushed opponents by 369 yards This is in part due to the best facet of Denvers game the defense The front seven contained running backs to 24 yards per carry and allowed an average of 508 yards a game The unit also has two recovered fumbles and four interceptions on the year Luckily for the Redskins the Broncos will have to descend from their milehigh city and meet Washington at FedExField for the last home game of the season',\n",

Washington Redskins have compiled a gallery of highlights From the lastminute win against the Los Angeles Rams to the Sunday Night blowout of the Oakland Raiders Washingtons players on offense and defense made some outstanding feats Here is some of the best of Redskins football a quarter of the way through the 2017 season Kerrigans PickSix Ignites FedEx Field With a 13point deficit against a division rival at home Washingtons season opener was about to get out of hand Philadelphia quarterback Carson Wentz had eluded the Redskins front seven and had already thrown two touchdowns If not for linebacker Ryan Kerrigan Washington may have been down by three touchdowns before halftime On the Eagles fifth drive Wentz tossed a short pass the right sideline The ball was tipped at the line by defensive lineman Stacy McGee wobbled off course and landed right in Kerrigans hands From there it was a short 25yard jog to the end zone Its what you practice every day just catching the ball and taking it to the house Kerrigan said Fortunate to find myself in that situation and fortunate to make the play Kerrigan scored Washingtons first points of the season and brought his team right back in the game Thompson Bullies His Way To Incredible TD Washingtons second big play of the season came when the team needed it most Down 137 against the Eagles the Redskins were on the move and within scoring range Cousins feeling the pressure from the blitz checked down to running back Chris Thompson in the middle of the field Thompson sprinted and spun his way through four missed tackles before reaching the end zone His 29yard catchandrun gave Washington its first and only lead of the game I was just looking to make a big play Thompson said I got a trips route and I always want coach Gruden to call a twist route for me and he gave me the opportunity and I just made a play Thompson Goes 61 Yards To The House Thompson continued his highlightfilled campaign in Week 3 against the Los Angeles Rams With a 1310 lead head coach Jay Gruden called in a delayed handoff for the gadget running back The Rams fell for the draw rushing towards Cousins who quickly gave the ball to his running back My first touchdown I think they ran pretty much an allout blitz to my side and I was free releasing Thompson said Just everybody around me did such a great job so it just feels good to continue to be a spark for our offense and just make plays A few nice blocks busted the field wide open for Thompson who never touched a defender on his way to the end zone The Redskins went up 2010 following the extra point and eventually earned their first win of the season Foster Seals Win In LA With Interception Rookie quarterback Jared Goff had kept his Los Angeles Rams afloat against the Redskins and needed just one drive to tie things up at 27 in the fourth quarter With seconds ticking off the clock Goff dropped back at his own 28yard line and slung the ball to receiver Cooper Kupp What Goff didnt see was linebacker Mason Foster making a beeline for the ball He cut in front up Kupp and bobbled the ball before securing the interception Foster who had been battling a shoulder injury during the game slid down at the 19yardline essentially ending the game and handing Washington its first win I mean it definitely feels great Foster said I felt like I had to redeem myself for some of the plays last week I felt like I could have been better on Doctson Hauls In 52Yard Bomb From Cousins Wide receiver Josh Doctson barely saw the field his rookie year and spent most of his time sidelined and injured During the Redskins Week 3 game against the Oakland Raiders Doctson blazed back into action redeeming himself on a 52yard touchdown pass Washington had already put up 14 points on the Raiders but it was Doctsons score that put the nail in the coffin On first down quarterback Kirk Cousins fired deep to the TCU product who had to contest with cornerback David Amerson for the 5050 ball Doctson miraculously came down with the catch and fought to reach the end zone Amerson still wrapped around his waist Nicholson and Fuller Light Up Sunday Night Before Week 3 Oakland quarterback Derek Carr had not been intercepted It took just one pass against Washingtons secondary for that to change One Carrs first pass attempt of the game receiver Amari Cooper slowed down just enough for the ball to sail out of reach Safety Montae Nicholson flew in and snatched the ball before Cooper could reach it setting Washington up for its first touchdown Cornerback Kendall Fuller nabbed Carrs second interception taking advantage of an underthrown pass intended for Seth Roberts midway through the second quarter Just a few plays later the Redskins found themselves ahead by two touchdowns Pryor Silences Arrowhead Stadium With 44Yard Score Wide receiver Terrelle Pryor Sr gave his team an early lead after hauling in an bomb from quarterback Kirk Cousins Three minutes into the game Cousins looked to the right sideline and saw a oneonone matchup between Pryor and defensive back Marcus Peters Cousins tested the matchup and saw immediate success Pryor nudged away from Peters just enough to get open without drawing a flag and caught Cousins pass which flew just beyond the outstretched fingertips of Peters Washington would go up 70 and stayed competitive the entire game against the NFLs last undefeated team of 2017',\n",
       " 'Redskinscoms Stephen Czarda answers YOUR questions submitted on Twitter about the Redskins roster and more as the team enjoys a Week 5 bye ShrihanVijay asks Redskins HailMail When is Josh Norman returning Well get more of an official update on Normans status this week as the Redskins return to practice following their bye week Having said that Redskins head coach Jay Gruden said after last weeks game against the Kansas City Chiefs that Norman is currently weektoweek with a rib fracture Norman hinted on Twitter that his return may not be for another month leaving Washington potentially without their star cornerback for the next few weeks Its just very disappointing that I wasnt able to be there with my teammates when they needed me the most Norman said after the Kansas City game Like I said Im pretty upset right now Human mortal body and you try to go out there and think youre more than that and sometimes it sits you down and realize makes you see that were still here on earth When were out there we try to be more than that If Norman really is out for the next few weeks the Redskins will likely rely on Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill the void opposite Bashaud Breeland and Kendall Fuller in the slot Dunbar originally filled in for Norman after his exit against the Chiefs but the thirdyear Florida product was also briefly sidelined with Moreau coming in for a few plays Now in his third season at cornerback after making the switch from wide receiver as a rookie Dunbar has appeared in 29 regular season games with four starts As for Moreau hes mostly played special teams to date for the Redskins But Gruden said that defensive backs coach Torrian Gray had the UCLA product as one of the highest rated cornerbacks in the 2017 NFL Draft Now the Redskins could see what the 23yearold offers from a defensive aspect early in his career RealMacDaddy asks How are we going forward with the running game We have success but Perine doesnt seem like he can get it done HailMail This has been a question thats been asked quite a bit over the last few months but the answer has remains the same When healthy Rob Kelley remains the Redskins featured back with Samaje Perine spelling the secondyear Tulane product at times Then of course theres Chris Thompson who has gotten off to a hot start as Washingtons thirddown back Through Washingtons first four games of the season Perine is actually the leading rusher with 143 yards to Thompsons 142 and Kelleys 131 This has mostly been due to the fact that Kelley missed the second half of the Redskins games against the Los Angeles Rams and Chiefs while also being inactive against the Oakland Raiders Perine has flashed bigplay potential at times but the 2017 fourthround pick had a late fumble against the Raiders and failed to secure a pitch from Kirk Cousins against the Chiefs The fumble went down under Cousins name but it was Perine who never was able to keep his hands on the ball before it rolled out of bounds Despite a few ball security errors Gruden and the coaching staff are confident Perine can have success in his rookie campaign I think hes still in the process of developing like all young running backs are Gruden said The kid for Kansas City is a special guy Kareem Hunt but Perine is in a spot right now where hes just continuing to get the workload especially if Rob Kelley has got an ankle injury for any due time Hes going to get more and more reps and hes going to get better and better JKStoneberger asks Vernon Davis looks like he has found his youth Is it possible since Garcon is gone that Davis can be a hybrid TEReciever HailMail It seems like theres nothing that can slow down Vernon Davis Now in his 12 th NFL season at 33 years old Davis possesses speed and agility that players 10 years his youth dont even have for their game After being held catchless in the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles Davis has caught eight passes for 160 yards and a touchdown in Washingtons last three games He followed up a fivecatch 58yard performance against the Raiders with two catches for 89 yards against the Chiefs A 69yard catchandrun moved Davis past Heath Miller 6569 for the 10thmost career receiving yards by a tight end in NFL history And entering Week 5 action his 20 yards per reception paced all NFL tight ends Hes the most impressive guy Ive been around really as far as taking care of his body and whatever hes doing he needs to tell all our young guys to do it because hes amazing Gruden said last week Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player He takes care of himself While theres so many positives to Davis game the Redskins still want to get reps for their young receivers in Terrelle Pryor Sr Josh Doctson and even Ryan Grant So it may be hard to picture Davis role expanding past what it already is a toplevel No 2 tight end option who can fill in for Jordan Reed if needed Sure he can make the tough catches but the Redskins want to get the wide receivers more involved on a consistent basis Theres certainly still a lot of hope that Doctson can fill some of what Pierre Garon left behind when he signed with the San Francisco 49ers Even though Doctson dropped a potential gamewinning touchdown against Kansas City hes beginning to make more plays in the passing game I have no problem with any of them at any given time but I think the more Josh obviously if he can stay healthy gets on the practice field does it in practice the more reps he will get Gruden said Were fine with Josh and where hes at',\n",

       " 'The Redskins tight end spent 10 years with the San Francisco 49ers after they selected him in the 2005 NFL Draft Sunday hell face them for the first time in his career In 2006 the San Francisco 49ers entered the NFL Draft seeking to bolster an offense that finished last in the NFL in total offense With secondyear quarterback Alex Smith the No 1overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft already in the fold San Francisco wanted to surround him with talent So with the No 6overall pick in the 2006 NFL Draft the 49ers selected University of Maryland tight end Vernon Davis It was just the fourth time in NFL Draft history that a tight end was selected in the first six picks Expectations were high for Davis especially after stellar showing at the NFL Combine in which he ran the 40yard dash in 438 seconds still a record among tight ends while tallying a broad jump nearly a foot further than the competition at his position Despite the heavy expectations placed on him Davis didnt disappoint during his time with the 49ers In nineplus seasons in San Francisco the Washington DC native recorded 441 receptions for 5640 yards and 55 touchdowns He toppled 850 receiving yards in three different seasons had two 13touchdown campaigns and was a twotime Pro Bowler Even though Davis was a centerpiece for some of San Franciscos best teams of the last decade his time with the 49ers quietly came to an end two years ago when he was traded midseason to the Denver Broncos This Sunday will mark the first time hes faced the team that drafted him since his departure It feels great Its been a while since Ive ran into the San Francisco 49ers Davis said this week Its going to be great I look forward to it Its going to be great to see some of the people that I had an opportunity to cultivate relationships with when I got drafted so that will be nice I cant wait for that While Davis has a lot of memories playing with the same 49ers team hell oppose this week he understood why he was traded His focus now 23 months after his 49ers tenure ended is helping the Washington Redskins get to 32 on the young season You get to a point where you move on You understand its the nature of the business It happens Davis said You play with the team you get traded or just something happens For me its just another game Im just really really excited to be able to see some of the familiar faces that I had to cultivate relationships with It looked as if Davis had slowed significantly during his time with the Broncos He recorded just 20 receptions for 201 yards in nine regular season games and didnt factor in at all during the teams playoff run to Super Bowl 50 Even though he admitted that he was never fully comfortable in Denver Davis has rebounded in Washington In 2016 Davis recorded 44 receptions for 583 yards and two touchdowns This past offseason he was rewarded with a new contract that will keep him in his hometown for a little bit longer So far the Redskins decision to resign him has paid off Entering Week 5 action Davis paced all tight ends with an average of 20 yards per reception On A 69yard catchandrun against the Kansas City Chiefs Davis moved past Heath Miller 6569 for the 10thmost career receiving yards by a tight end in NFL history Catching the ball at Kansas Citys 45yard line in stride Davis zigzagged his way through the defense for his longest reception since the 2010 season It showed that Davis still has a lot left in the tank even in his 12 th NFL season Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins said hes been nicknamed el caballo because hes like a thoroughbred the way he runs down the field Redskins head coach Jay Gruden meanwhile describes him as a physical freak Its proof that Davis is still very much the same player he was during his time with the 49ers Hes just one of those guys you look forward to seeing every day and then you watch him practice and its always hard and effective Great guy great player He takes care of himself',\n",

Redskins win DONT LET PIERRE GET COMFORTABLE IN A FAMILIAR SETTING It will be an interesting site on Sunday when the San Francisco offense takes the field for the first time and Pierre Garon is wearing a No 15 49ers jersey For five seasons 201216 Garon was a mainstay for Washingtons offense In total the former Mount Union product finished his time in Washington in the top 10 in both receptions 376 and receiving yards 4549 in franchise history His 21 touchdown receptions are also tied for 12th most among all Redskins skill players in history While he has yet to score so far in his 49ers tenure hes right on track for another 1000yard season Through five games he has 28 receptions for 379 yards Washingtons cornerbacks even without former AllPro Josh Norman have to be ready for Garons aggressive attitude Hes an exceptional guy he makes plays on the ball and as well he runs his routes hard said cornerback Bashaud Breeland who will slide into the No 1 role during Normans injury Its going to be a good task Im all for it San Francisco may not have the bevy of playmakers at its disposal like Washington but head coach Kyle Shanahan likes to move Garon around to get him into advantageous spots Even if hes asked to run shorter routes or go across the middle Redskins head coach Jay Gruden knows hes still one of the top possessiontype receivers in the game today He is really good after the catch Thats the one thing we really have to make sure that we tackle well when he gets the ball in his hands out in space because he can really run after the catch Gruden said He runs very good precise crisp routes and has got strong hands He does all the underneath stuff He can hit you down the sidelines from time to time so he is definitely their best playmaker Stephen Czarda PREPARE FOR THE YOUNG AND HUNGRY While the 49ers enter Sundays game without a win on their resume the Redskins understand that San Francisco could easily have four wins on the season After losing a rather onesided game in the opener against the Carolina Panthers the 49ers last four losses have been by a combined 11 points And in each of their last two games they were taken out in overtime I know the feeling of being winless and just being anxious to finally get that first win said running back Chris Thompson So theyre going to come out wanting to beat us wanting to upset us at home Despite their failure to secure a win so far this year the 49ers have talent on both sides of the ball Offensively of course Garon is the steady threat on the outside complemented by speedsters Aldrick Robinson and Marquise Goodwin They also have Carlos Hyde at running back as the Ohio State product once again is averaging more than 45 yards per carry Defensively San Francisco is loaded with young talent particularly along the line Arik Armstead DeForest Buckner and Solomon Thomas were all taken in the first round of their respective NFL Drafts Armstead and Buckner both offer unique size coupled with their athleticism as both are 6foot7 and more than 290 pounds So for a Washington offense that could be without Trent Williams and Rob Kelley the team must be ready for a group thats ready to strike They have talent Gruden said We are talking about Buckner and Armstead Solomon Thomas and then they bring Elvis Dumervil off the bench for third down rusher Aaron Lynch is a good rusher So they are very talented without a doubt The linebacker play has been solid and obviously they have safeties out the kazoo Stephen Czarda GET CROWDER AND REED THEIR REDEMPTION Washington has quite a bit of depth at the tight end position and its showed so far this season While veteran Vernon Davis leads the teams tight end receiving yards two other players will look to make an impact on Sundays game Jordan Reed who missed the Oakland game entirely and saw limited action against Kansas City finally appears to be ready to go Jamison Crowder another weapon who has dealt with injuries also seems likely as a major factor against the 49ers I think youll see more of Jamison Crowder hopefully head coach Jay Gruden said He is one of our best skill players We have got to get him more involved in the offense Reed and Crowder have almost identical stats through four games With 14 receptions apiece Crowder 107 yards inched pass Reed 106 yards in receiving two weeks ago Gruden said defenses have been clogging the middle of the field to prevent big plays from Washingtons various tight ends He added that will likely change as the outside receivers improve opening up more opportunities for Crowder and Reed underneath We have a number of guys that we need to get the ball to but it is key for us to just be patient spread the ball and get the ball to the open guy Gruden said Brandon Hill FILLING THE NORMAN VOID In the absence of star cornerback Josh Norman while hes dealing with a rib fracture Gruden and defensive coordinator Greg Manusky will look upon a duo of young cornerbacks in Quinton Dunbar and Fabian Moreau to fill his shoes Dunbar a thirdyear player out of Florida is expected to make the fifth start of his career on Sunday his first of the 2017 season Despite the relative lack of starting experience on the field the 25yearold is not short on confidence He thinks he can cover anybody anytime anywhere Gruden said And thats a great mentality to have as a corner and thats the way he feels Hes been out here at practice covering DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garon last year and this year with all these other guys Moreau meanwhile is looking to seize an increased role in Normans absence The rookie has appeared in all four of the Redskins games this season and has recorded six tackles While fans have not seen much of the UCLA product in a regular season setting just yet Gruden stresses the importance of his physical tools in Sundays matchup against the 49ers He has speed Gruden said of his rookie defensive back Dunbar and Fabian both are very very fast and that helps when youre playing against a worldclass sprinter like Marquise Goodwin and Aldrick Robinson Theyre both very very fast So its very important we try to match some speed with speed and those guys can both run Jay Cannon',\n",

       " 'The former University of Wisconsin star signed with Washingtons practice squad last week His fourth NFL team Stave is trying to learn the Redskins system as he goes One month and one day after being waived by the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Joel Stave was signed by the Washington Redskins joining the team as a practice squad member last week Ever since his senior season at Wisconsin in 2015 Stave has bounced around the league appearing on the rosters of four NFL teams since May of 2016 Going undrafted in the 2016 NFL Draft Stave signed with the Minnesota Vikings as a practice squad member and has since made stops in Seattle and Kansas City Throughout a frustrating month of September Stave went back to his roots in the Milwaukee area spending time with his dad and even trying his hand at woodworking to pass the time After the month at home in Wisconsin he was understandably happy to get the call from the Redskins It was fun getting a call and having a chance to come and workout So far I really like the staff I like the guys Stave toldf Redskinscom As long as youre getting calls its a good time For Stave this is not the first time he has had the task of getting acclimated to a new locker room but he seems to be handling it well with the Redskins Its different every time the quarterback said Most important thing is that you got to come in and take care of your business If I do everything I can to learn the offense as quick as possible and just help out wherever I can help out thats a good way to get yourself used to a team and get guys comfortable being around you and you the same being comfortable being around them Stave joins a duo of experienced players in Kirk Cousins and Colt McCoy to fill out the quarterback crew Both Cousins and McCoy have been on the Redskins roster for several years now and are easy guys to work with as Stave attests to They both seem like excellent guys Stave said I was a redshirt freshman when Kirk was in his senior year at Michigan State so I got to watch him play a couple times live there And obviously I knew all about Colt coming out of Texas but its cool to get to meet the guys and talk to them a little bit The 6foot4 gunslinger comes to Washington after a standout career at Wisconsin where he graduated as the alltime winningest quarterback at the school with a record of 3110 Stave was able to see the field in two games for the Chiefs this preseason going 4of9 on passes with 80 yards and a touchdown',\n",
       " 'Redskinscoms Jake KringSchreifels provides five takeaways from Kirk Cousins s press conference at the Inova Sports Performance Center at Redskins Park in Loudoun Co Va 1 Being a father has given him a broader perspective about playing football Predictably becoming a father for the first time has given Cousins a better perspective about how to approach his life and football career When you throw a few interceptions and come home from a tough loss I think itsgoing to eat at you a little less Cousins said I think when you re on top of the world after a big win youre going to come home and realize that youre not as big of a deal as you think you are I think thats a healthy thing Cousins said he read Drew Brees book that discussed how the Saints quarterback had better time management after the birth of his son because it gave him incentives to finish certain priorities on time so he could be home longer with his family Ray Wright our old strength coach whos now in San Francisco when I got married said I believe youre not your best self as a player until your married Cousins said A lot of times guys play better once theyre married and Id maybe even say the same thing about having a son I think you could maybe even become a better football player after that happens 2 He would have preferred a later Bye Week but was glad to have time with his son The Redskins received their Bye Week on the early side this season coming after just four games This came in handy for many on the defensive side of the ball that got injured during the Chiefs game but it now means that the team must prepare itself for 12 consecutive weeks without break Ultimately Cousins would prefer to have a Bye Week closer to the middle of the season like they did last year after visiting London but he was also happy to spend the first week of his newborn son Coopers life without his typical work week I think we were fortunate with the timing of our babys arrival that the Bye Week came when it did but its always tough when its so early Cousins said You prefer a Bye Week later in the year when its really a halftime of the season but well take what we can get Earlier in the year I guess like I said we had the benefit with our baby and when you go back and look at the start of training camp and how long weve been going at it it probably is about halfway now Well take advantage of the time we rested and got recharged and were ready to go now During the Bye week Cousins posted a lot of photos of his time with Cooper showing off his dad swag I felt like I had dad swag before I was a dad Im the kind of guy in high school who would wear a braided belt and cargo shorts White socks that came up half way up my ankles Cousins joked I was probably one step away from Velcro shoes and a visor and an oversized polo tucked in Maybe even a Palm Pilot on my belt Actually Kyle Shanahan used to tell me when he saw me in my game uniform he said Kirk your swag is having no swag Thats kind of always been my swag and I guess Ill stick with it But yeah I guess I kind of fit the dad vibe for the most part 3 Hes developed a lot as a quarterback even over the last year Just because Cousins is in his third year as the starting quarterback doesnt mean there are things he isnt intent on improving With each year comes more comfortability and more nuances for Cousins to develop and hone Well Ive developed every area of my game from the end of year two to now in the middle of year six Cousins said Everything from protections audibles understanding the run game reads coverage recognition blitz recognition Just how to handle a 16 game season and how to win in this league how to play on the road Theres so many elements of being a quarterback As Ive played Ive picked them all up and I feel like every year I take another step Cousins has attributed most of his progress to the coaches around him I think most of us need to have great people around us to be successful he said Maybe not the case with every player but most of us do and Im no different Ive been so fortunate to have Mike Shanahan Kyle Shanahan Matt Lafleur those people leading me my first few years And then to have Sean McVay Jay Gruden Matt Cavanaugh Ive felt like has had a big impact on my career and now Kevin OConnell 4 Kyle Shanahan always believed in his potential which has meant a lot to him The Redskins will face some familiar opponents this weekend when they host the 49ers Theres wide receiver Pierre Garon who Cousins knew for his whole career playing for the Burgundy and Gold and then there is former offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan The latter played an important role in Cousins young NFL career as he developed at the professional level After providing a list of quarterback coaches and offensive coaches that have impacted his career Cousins pointed out Shanahan for a specific reason Kyle stands out looking back just because the information we have now we didnt have then Cousins said No one knew what was going to happen and Kyle believed in me when it was just potential There was no production I hadnt done anything to earn his belief and he believed in me and Mike Shanahan did too and Matt Lafleur for that matter I think thats when I look back and say Wow those guys knew what they were talking about because I hadnt done anything and they told me I had a lot of potential and could do something I think thats when I look back and then respect their knowledge at the quarterback position and what it takes to play well in this league Cousins had goals that were as simple as making the team knowing that next year was never promised to him Hearing that belief from Mike from Kyle from Matt right away gave me a chance to set my sights a little higher and to expect a little more out of myself and to work for more Cousins said It certainly is a shot in the arm when someone believes in you and that was the case and like I said Ive been fortunate to have that really all the way through my career 5 Cousins is constantly involved in talking with receivers to refine their connections While the offense has steadily progressed injuries to receivers have made things inconsistent Jordan Reed Josh Doctson Jamison Crowder and the full potential of the receiving corps hasnt been able to blossom After every game Cousins makes sure to speak with each of his teammates to go over route concepts that the team missed the previous week Cousins has noticed that all of his receivers care deeply about the details of their games and work actively with him on correcting mistakes and learn what the other is thinking about Theres a lot of precision with these routes the spacing and the timing and the depth and the motions and all that comes with reps and experience Ive been encouraged just because everyone in our offense wants to be on the details Cousins said We really care about the details and want to do it right and so its fun to work with them and coach them up and vice versa I respect them when they have something for me because I understand theyre trying to do it the right way Cousins elaborated on where and how these meetings exist I could be passing Ike Hilliard in the hall and say Hey tell Josh Doctson in his under route to get his shoulders down or it could be me passing Josh in the hall and saying the same thing It could be us in a meeting with Jay saying Hey why are we doing it this way Did we tell Terrelle Pryor Sr that already So its an ongoing conversation throughout the day and because we all love football we all are junkies and kind of eat it up and want to talk ball throughout the entire day',\n",

positive through adversity and his experience living on the west coast How did you spend your Bye Week I spent the Bye Week playing Crash Bandicoot Mario Kart and just getting treatment I didnt really do anything Just tried to heal up came in here every morning for treatment My son got good grades he got a good report so I went and bought him a Nintendo Switch and they got the Mario Kart with the steering wheels We went crazy spent the whole week playing it treatment and Mario Kart Did you play it a lot by yourself or with your son A little bit of both I didnt think the Nintendo Switch was going to be that cool but when I got it for him it was off the hook Then the Crash Bandicoot is for the PS4 and hes really good Some of the levels are really hard so I have to pass him during the daytime I dont want him to see me die over and over I just try to pass him when hes at school How old are your two boys Rylan is four and a half and Kannon will be three in December I saw you took Rylan to swim lessons over the weekend Lessons are usually on Thursdays I used to be able to go after practice and stuff Now its Saturday so I cant make it Its cool They graduated their little classes theyre swimming pretty good now so its pretty crazy to see little kids swim like that What prompted you to get them into swim class When we were in Tampa we had a pool when Rylan was born and he just loves water So hes been doing swim lessons since he was eight to 10 months old They have a lot of swim classes in South Tampa so hes been learning to swim for a while And both my boys are like that so we had to get them swim lessons as soon as possible because theyll jump right in Did you learn to swim growing up Yeah my mom is a really good swimmer But I didnt really learn how to swim until I was seven years old I would just stay in the shallow end of the pool But my mom taught me we went to Hawaii one time in two days It was pretty crazy Did you see any movies over the break I saw the new Blade Runner Howd you like it It was good It was long I was thinking I would just pop into it after treatment but it was like three hours It was really good Ive got to see Kingsman Ive been slipping but Blade Runner scifi thats my kind of stuff Eventually you can take your kids to that movie but not right now Not right now theyre straight Teen Titans thats all they want to watch That sounds like a fitting title for what theyll become Yeah theyre going to be superheroes or something Astronauts One of the two On a separate topic I still cant imagine what its like to play with a shoulder thats been dislocated How would you describe it Its a little weird Its definitely painful and you feel restricted But for the most part its just about pain Your shoulder is already kind of messed up so if you can deal with the pain its whatever The pain its bad but its a part of football As long as I can play to the level I feel I can play to help the team win then I was alright I just love playing football I wouldnt want to miss any of that As long as it stays locked down and doesnt pop out again Im alright Do you feel offbalance or offkilter Maybe before with my other one my left was a little weird But here we have great athletic trainers great doctors and equipment people They way theyve got it locked down and set up and all the rehab I do makes it feel great It gets beat up but theyre able to bring me back the next day and Im ready to go again Where does the interception you had against Jared Goff rank amongst plays youve made with the Redskins Oh thats number one definitely Last year I didnt really get to play too much on third down or be on twominute drives I feel like you make those kinds of splash plays its something I really always wanted to do ever since college try to make interceptions and sacks big plays that end the game It was good to get one as a Redskin especially in the Coliseum Its something youll never forget I remember earlier this offseason when you told me that your only concern was winning regardless of your role Were you unsure about how much you were going to play or what your role would be this season I kind of had a feeling that I was going to get a chance to play It was really just talking about special teams whatever they need me to do I know that no matter who they bring in no matter who comes at the end of the day its all competition So I knew if it was competing against ZachBrown Will Compton Martrell Spaight whoever I knew it was going to be a competition I was going to give them my best I know theyre going to give me their best At the end of the day it was about winning If Im giving my best every day and you can beat me out then you deserved it and were going to be alright Thats all it was about Its still the same way Even after the Bye Week all you want to do is win no matter what you got to do You had also mentioned that joining the Redskins made you fall in love with football again Has that love continued to grow this season Definitely You spend four years in Tampa You go to the Bears and get cut Ive never been a quitter and always seen it through to the end but that was like probably the first time in my life where I was probably thinking like I can go do something else How deep did those thoughts go I got cut the last day of camp then probably the next couple of days I had my cousins with me in Chicago and I really was just talking to everybody My best friend from college and my frat brother a strength coach at South Dakota he was like Bruh dont let that stuff get you down Come here you can sleep on my couch well train and it worked out But that was really it those 48 hours where I was just thinking Ill go back to school Im going to go coach Im going to help University of Washington Thats not where my mind should have been at but thats why you have a good circle of friends Your family is there for you all of the time Once I came here Jay and linebackers coach Kirk Olivadotti and all the fellas in the locker room it just made me feel like I love football again Even if I wasnt starting because I started my whole life but it was just being on a team where people cared about you coaches are having fun everybodys playing hard I gravitated towards that It made me want to stay here and continue to help this team win Looking back did it seem silly to have that anxiety Yeah I mean it definitely did because Ive never been that type of person but you kind of felt like some of the stuff that happened in Chicago was a little weird the way the situation played out Its a business and youve just got to keep trucking That was one of the big moments in my career I cant believe I thought for a second that I was done or washed up I still feel like I can play All of my friends my mom my dad everybody close to me was like Bro just go train trust me and it really helped me out Now I know I can do whatever I put my mind to Will Compton reads a lot on psychology and mental training Have you always felt like youve been in a positive mental space too Ive always been super optimistic See the good in people Stay positive How tough is that to do Its pretty tough Especially when you get in those situations like in Chicago That was probably the only time ever Even when I was in Tampa we were 214 I went into every game and thought we were going to beat them by 21 points Thats just how I feel I believe in everyone in this organization wholeheartedly Theyre the best that do their job When I went into that dark thinking maybe Im not as good as I think maybe this isnt for me that was tough because that was the first time I ever really felt like that I had never felt negative about a situation that bad where I wanted to give up It changed a lot of stuff for me I started reading more books What did you read I read the book The Art of Mental Training which was a good way to get your mind on how to eliminate bad thoughts and carry yourself like a champion envision yourself doing this and that That helped me a lot The main thing Im Omega Psi Phi fraternity so both of my line brothers were really on me about You cant let this stuff break you youve got to keep pushing See it through Its really what got me through all of that Youll look at yourself in the mirror and know that you gave it your all You reached out to someone on Twitter and gave him tickets in exchange for community service Has social media been your way to stay positive Definitely Its little way to try and get people to pay it forward I always do that for kids who need tickets or something Just do something nice When youre a good person good things happen to you Thats how my dad raised me Youre a good person good stuff will happen to you sooner or later Its something little but you see it it helps them out a lot I didnt even think about how much it would just pay it forward You be the first one to help them move or hold the door for somebody if people start doing little stuff like that thats the start Thats just the tip of the sword It just gets deeper You can get people to be good people to everybody then you never know what can happen Has it been easier to try since theres been a lot of negativity surrounding players over the last month Its always crazy because most of the guys that I know and I interact with every single day are great guys The best dads I know the best husbands I know the best brothers I know so its crazy that people see NFL players in this crazy light Its part of the game You play a violent sport Sometimes youre going to get viewed that way But I think the stuff people are doing in the community the stuff people do outside of football shows what type of people all these guys are It would be easy just to sit at home and not do anything and turn a blind eye to it I feel like a lot of guys are standing up reaching out into the community and helping out behind closed doors not doing it for any certain reason but to help someone out I think that means a lot to a lot of NFL players Youre a laidback guy too Does that stem from growing up on the west coast Definitely Its probably just from my grandpa My whole family is like that laidback Of course theyre going to be tough on you tough love if you need it and I was one of those hardheaded kids that needed it What was your grandpa like He was real cool We had Grandpa Thursdays This was my dads dad Every Thursday night he would invite everybody over all the grandkids and the cousins Hed cook us all a bunch of food for us to hang out together I feel like he was always helping people out in our neighborhood no matter what My granny my moms parents lived four houses down So we would just bounce around I spent a lot of time with them my mom and dad both worked so my grandpa would pick us up on Fridays Me and my friends it didnt matter who I would be with wed go bowling It pretty much came from that just being a cool person everybody loved my grandpa because of that It was like I could be that too help people out smile listen to people when they need to talk to you It goes a long way for people And living in Seaside Calif and then Seattle those are pretty diverse areas Thats one of the reasons why I fell in in love with Seattle You get the same vibes San Francisco Bay Area Northern California people just chilling Nobodys really judging each other people are just chilling Its pretty cool and its something that I just gravitated towards Im glad I made that decision I wanted to go experience new places Youve lived in the Pacific Northwest the Midwest the Southeast and the Northeast now Do you feel fortunate about living in nearly every time zone and region I love it You never really know how people are Where I grew up theres all different types of people Filipinos Guatemalans Polynesians Samoans so its cool to go to other places and see that everybodys the same but everybodys different Its cool to see everyones variations I love it A lot of people dont get that experience Its cool to meet kids in DC go to the middle schools in Tampa and play basketball with the little kids Which coast has the better food I would say the west coast We just got a certain mix When I was in high school we had Aloha Rallies and multicultural lunches Every culture brought its own food You could just bounce around It was pretty much peoples parents and grandparents cooking Definitely get some egg rolls fried rice I think the west coast just because they have a lot of variety The weather is also so drastically different I cant imagine living in Tampa It doesnt rain as long per day Seattle its just those gray gloomy skies all day Tampa it would rain hard for 10 minutes but then its going to be back to sunny and hot Then the alligators Being in Seattle and then going all the way down to Tampa it was the lockout so I didnt really get to Tampa until camp It was hot There was a bunch of bugs but it just makes you grow up as a person Learn on the run What does the next three quarters of the season look like for you and the team I think its just a continuous climb I think guys know where were at We just want to keep getting better everybody wants to keep getting better You take the Bye Week to really identify look in the mirror see what you did I rewatched all the games see where I can get better Just keep getting better one two three each day is a new day I think people see the potential that we have as a team Now its about making it go happen Nobody likes that shoulda coulda woulda stuff What was your favorite tackle so far It was probably one of those on Monday night Coming off a shoulder injury people never know is he going to be My first play I hit the running back and I was like Im alright So that was a good feeling for me like to really hit somebody Its definitely one Ill remember Is there a certain feeling you have when you know youve made a good tackle Its like hitting the baseball on the sweet spot of the bat You cant even feel it but you know you hit it just right hard enough A good tackle you bring your feet arms he goes backwards Its a great feeling There aint nothing like it I asked Ryan Kerrigan this question and he had a good response Whats the strangest thing youve received unsolicited in the mail from a fan It was something weird for your nose or maybe for your head Some new product It wasnt that weird because I tried it and I mean that might work but I was like I dont think you can just put it on your helmet It was like nasal strips or a skull cap At least people are thinking about you I had something cool sent Im a big wrestling fan my little boys wrestle nonstop They think theyre like a tagteam One of the fans he sent me two tagteam champion of the world belts that they wear around That was super cool I always

       " 'The Redskins jumped out to a 170 lead against the 49ers before having to stave off a comeback attempt by San Francisco to get a third victory on the year Fourth Quarter Redskins 26 49ers 24 On the first play of the final frame Chris Thompson moved the chains with a 13yard reception on 3 rd and12 The catch means Thompson now has his second career 100yard receiving game The Redskins would eventually get inside the 10yard line but the 16play drive did not result in a touchdown as second and first down runs were stopped before a third down incompletion Dustin Hopkins would make a 21yard field goal though to push the Redskins back into the lead at 2017 The defense meanwhile allowed just one first down before locking down the 49ers offense to force a punt After a short punt return by Jamison Crowder the offense got the ball back with a little more than eight minutes left in the game with the Redskins up by three Cousins would complete his first two passes of the drive before Samaje Perine moved the chains on a 3 rd and1 run Then on Cousins third pass of the drive the quarterback connected with tight end Vernon Davis for a massive 51yard gain that put the Redskins deep into 49ers territory The 49ers then were called for defensive holding to give the Redskins a new set of downs at the sevenyard line which gave Washingtons offense new life On the new set of downs Cousins called his own number on an option run to get the Redskins another touchdown While Hopkins missed his extra point attempt the Redskins now lead by nine The 49ers would match the touchdown though as CJ Beathard found Aldrick Robinson for a 45yard touchdown with less than two minutes left in the game San Franciscos onside kick attempt was caught by Fabian Moreau and Washington would run the ball three times before Tress Way came out to punt with exactly one minute left The ball would go into the end zone for a touchback While the 49ers would get into Redskins territory a late offensive pass interference call pushed San Francisco back to midfield with 19 seconds left After three incompletions the 49ers went for it on 4thand20 with nine seconds left but Kendall Fuller tallied his second interception of the season to close out the game Third Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 17 San Francisco got the ball to start the third quarter but linebacker Ryan Kerrigan prevented the 49ers from getting a second touchdown when he recorded a timely sack on rookie quarterback CJ Beathard Two plays after the takedown by Kerrigan cornerback Kendall Fuller logged a diving pass defensed The 49ers would however tack on a 52yard field goal make to cut the Redskins lead to seven After a brief appearance by the offense Washingtons defense started at midfield following a big punt return by San Francisco The 49ers would miss a 47yard field goal attempt though after getting into Redskins territory On the drive cornerback Bashaud Breeland suffered a knee injury and his return is questionable Rookie Fabian Moreau took his spot in the lineup opposite Quinton Dunbar who replaced an injury Josh Norman for the game The offense would be on the field for just one play though as a Vernon Davis fumble was recovered by the 49ers After just one offensive play for San Francisco Carlos Hyde punched it in for his second touchdown of the game The extra point was good and the game is now tied Kirk Cousins would get the ball moving with an 18yard run on the ensuing drive following the 49ers touchdown Three plays later on 3 rd down Cousins would find an open Ryan Grant in the middle of the field for an 18yard gain to get into San Francisco territory Second Quarter Redskins 17 49ers 7 Working down the field with several short passes from Kirk Cousins to Jordan Reed and Jamison Crowder the Redskins got deep into 49ers territory before the quarterback found rookie Samaje Perine for a threeyard score The catch was the fourthround picks first career touchdown So far on the afternoon Cousins is 12of15 for 121 yards with two touchdown passes San Francisco would get their first positive moment on the afternoon early in the second quarter but Washingtons defense continued to hold stout to force a third punt for as many 49ers offensive drives this afternoon The Redskins couldnt get much going on the ensuing drive as Cousins was off on one pass that was ruled an incompletion before throwing his first interception since Week 1 on an offtarget deep toss down the right sideline After four punts the 49ers went to rookie quarterback CJ Beathard grandson of former Redskins general manager Bobby Beathard to replace Brian Hoyer The Iowa product would complete 1of4 passes on his debut drive before San Francisco called on the punt unit once again Set up by a 49yard screen pass completed to Chris Thompson the Redskins got into field goal range for kicker Dustin Hopkins who nailed a 48yard field goal attempt Thr 49ers though would score just before halftime as Carlos Hyde punched in a oneyard touchdown on 4thandgoal On the drive safety Montae Nicholson was removed from the game after a scary collision with former Redskins wide receiver PierreGaron one that would knock the rookies helmet off First Quarter Redskins 7 49ers 0 Like they did against both the Raiders and the Chiefs the Redskins first offensive drive against the 49ers ended with a touchdown The balanced attack drove 75 yards in just eight plays as Kirk Cousins completed all four of his passes including a touchdown throw to Josh Doctson while the ground game picked up 18 yards This is Doctsons second touchdown catch of the season as he also hauled in a 52yard score against the Raiders in Week 3 Dustin Hopkins extra point was good too as Washington jumped out to an early 70 lead The 49ers meanwhile could not match the Redskins offense as Washington forced San Francisco to punt after gaining just one first down On that drive the 49ers tried to get Pierre Garon on a big second down reception but Bashaud Breeland and Montae Nicholson forced an incompletion Despite the offense getting forced into a threeandout on its next drive the defense continued to show up early in this contest as they also forced a punt after just three plays On a third down dropback by Brian Hoyer Matt Ioannidis and Preston Smith were among those to take down the former Michigan State quarterback It looked like DJ Swearinger later in the quarter had his first career touchdown on a fumble recovery but Hoyers pass was ruled an incomplete pass Quinton Dunbar made sure the 49ers wouldnt get any momentum though as the thirdyear corner who is starting in place of Josh Norman logged a beautiful openfield tackle on third down Terrelle Pryor Sr would record his third catch of the opening frame before the quarter ended',\n",

       " 'After a strong start the Redskins defense started to bend against the San Francisco 49ers But when it mattered most a banged up secondary made the necessary plays to win the game A win is a win and as safety DJ Swearinger will tell you despite inconsistent play a banged up roster and near devastation thats all that really matters And indeed thats what the Redskins came away with on Sunday afternoon at FedExField beating the San Francisco 49ers 2624 in a game that fluctuated in momentum and emotion Washington began strong lost its grip midway through hung on long enough and then reestablished its hardnosed play with the game on the line and a losing streak to end With less than a minute left and up by two points the Redskins needing the entire list of defensive players to step in and contribute thanks to numerous injuries affecting the secondary once again kept the 49ers from field goal distance in the waning seconds to close out a victory San Franciscos final play a heave towards the sideline with nine seconds left was grabbed by cornerback Kendall Fuller who returned his second career interception a few yards before being mobbed by teammates in celebration solidifying the teams third win after another gutsy performance with a depleted depth chart We know the depth that we have in this secondary Fuller said Everybody can come out there everybody can make plays everybodys smart Thats just how weve got to do it as a group We bend but we dont break Swearinger offered And I told the guys this week in Kansas City we broke We broke I was just putting that out there so that we cant fail again Anytime it is in our hands to win the game weve got to win the game if we want to be a championship defense And we won the game The Redskins entered Sundays contest wellaware of the challenges they were facing Even though the 49ers had begun the year without a victory their talent and lategame energy showed up on tape Washington was also without its star cornerback in Josh Norman and safety Deshazor Everett needing its backups to play well and stay healthy Much like the teams game against the Chiefs the Redskins preparedness to fill the voids was tested early when Swearinger had to leave the game for a potential stinger The very next play his backup Stefan McClure collided with safety Montae Nicholson and injured his knee and ankle Both eventually returned but it forecasted the kind of day it would be In the third quarter trying to defend a run play 49ers running back Joe Staley made a cut block on cornerback Bashaud Breeland s knee that forced the training staff to help him off the field and he remained sidelined for the game head coach Jay Gruden said afterward he would receive an MRI on MCL on Monday forcing rookie cornerback Fabian Moreau to take over fulltime Without its two best cornerbacks and with San Franciscos offense beginning to find a rhythm with quarterback CJ Beathard who replaced Brian Hoyer in the first half the Redskins had to rely upon a handful of first and secondyear players in the secondary The defense mostly weathered the storm When people go down we still fight Breeland said No matter the changing of the game were still going to fight man I feel like we carry that over next week Itd be good for us Cornerback Quinton Dunbar filling in for Norman led the team with eight tackles and two passes defensed playing tight coverage on wide receiver Pierre Garon throughout and during the crucial waning seconds of the game That was needed after a blown coverage led to a 49ers touchdown pass to Aldrick Robinson which cut the lead to two points with just less than two minutes remaining Cornerback Fabian Moreau recovered San Franciscos onside kick but the Redskins offense while it managed to waste the 49ers timeouts couldnt accomplish a first down giving Beathard and co an opportunity to take the lead Throughout the entire week linebacker Zach Brown noted the teams focus on practicing twominute drills and playing under pressure With confidence in a young group of players knowing exactly what it needed to do the defense began to clamp down as the 49ers approached midfield On third down Dunbar batted a pass up in the air that Garon managed to still collect while keeping his knee in bound which was confirmed after review putting the ball at the Redskins 40yard line After an incompletion Beathard targeted Garon again on a slant route that fell incomplete when Brown ran into Garon in coverage That induced a penalty for offensive pass interference a flag that Brown and the defense had anticipated from watching previous games and recognizing the route combination taking shape before the snap I knew the play before it was going to happen Brown said I told DJ Swearinger I said Hey look they may throw it to Pierre Garcon because whenever the tight end is therePierre was cut split so I knew they were going to run a pick and try to give it to Carlos Hyde outside and Garon ran right into me so already knew it was going to be a flag on him because I was guarding my guy I got to have my right of way too I dont blink Dunbar said Like I was saying during the week football is pleasure for me What I went through growing up its fun I just live and play Thats all The play backed up San Francisco to the 50yard line where the defense gained more confidence and stood its ground forcing two consecutive incompletions before Fuller came down with the interception I think they all stepped up Gruden said Youre talking about not a lot of experience back there With Montae Nicholson playing safety Fabian Moreau and you saw Joshua Holsey back there and Kendall Fuller Obviously Quinton Dunbar had a big day today Very impressed with all of them There was a coverage mixup there that gave them a touchdown to get it back to a one or twopoint game but overall I liked the way they competed covered and played It just shows you that even when a star player or a good player goes down weve got the young guys to come in they know what theyre doing theyre going to fill the role Brown said Fuller made a play The defense stood up when it needed to The Redskins kept pace in the division As Swearinger said parts of the game were ugly but the outcome wasnt In a game that needed everyone the Redskins proved everyone was capable Im very confident in all of them linebacker Mason Foster said I practice with them every day I know that if I tell them something if DJ Swearinger tells them something if Zach Brown tells them something theyre going to be on the same page with us like clockwork Of course youre going to have little things messing that up and mistakes but youve just got to keep playing through it and thats what we did I think guys showed their resiliency today',\n",

their first shutout of the series three years after its beginning This was the first RedskinsEagles game played in the teams new home of Washington DC More than 7000 fans attended the matchup at Griffith Stadium Philadelphia quarterback Dave Smukler put the Eagles in front early with a 10yard touchdown pass Maurice Harper came up with an interception late in the fourth taking it 20 yards to the house and sealing the Eagles last win in the series for six years Washington rebounded from its blowout loss to Philadelphia finishing the season 83 and defeating the Chicago Bears in the NFL Championship October 8 1944 Tie 3131 It took six years and 11 straight losses for Philadelphia to claw its way back into the rivalry After making backtoback trips the NFL Championship in 1942 and 1943 the Redskins regressed from their usual NFL East domination Eagles quarterback Roy Zimmerman gave his team the biggest lead of the day finding Jack Ferrante 45 yards out for a touchdown Down 216 Washington fought back just before halftime on a 3yard touchdown pass from Frank Filchock to Les Dye Filchocks 44yard touchdown pass in the third quarter tied the game at 24 but a fumble returned for a touchdown put the Eagles back in front Wilbur Moore hauled in a 21yard touchdown before time expired to end the game with a tie October 17 1948 Eagles win 450 The biggest shutout in the series 82year history came during the Eagles first championship season The previous year the Eagles had put up 45 points against Washington but the Redskins managed to respond with each hit scoring 42 themselves In this 1948 game Philadelphia scored twice in each of the first three quarters and settled for a field goal only once The Eagles swept that years series during their eightgame winning streak against the Redskins and ended the season 92 beating the Chicago Cardinals in the NFL Championship November 24 th 1957 Eagles win 2112 In 1957 the Eagles used their fourthround pick to select Sonny Jurgensen out of Duke University Jurgensen spent his early years in Philadelphia as a backup but earned his first start against Washington in his rookie season Jurgensen led his team to victory at home throwing three touchdowns and 211 yards He saw less success later that year when the Redskins intercepted him three times and defeated the Eagles 427 October 21 1962 Redskins win 2721 Washington snapped a sixgame slide against the Eagles defeating Philadelphia on its home turf The Redskins defense shut down the efforts of both Jurgensen and King Hill recording four interceptions Receiver Bobby Mitchell caught eight of Norm Sneads passes for 147 yards and two touchdowns Jurgensen threw a late touchdown in the fourth quarter bringing the Eagles within six points but the Washington defense stayed true to form stopping any chance of lastminute heroics by the Philadelphia offense October 11 1964 Redskins win 3520 In April of 1964 the Eagles and Redskins took part in one of the most famous trades in NFL history Philadelphia sent Jurgensen to Washington in exchange for Snead and cornerback Claude Crabb When Jurgensen first met his former team on the field it was obvious who got the better end of the deal Washingtons new quarterback threw for 385 yards and five touchdowns After jumping out to a 210 lead the Redskins took their foot off the gas and allowed the Eagles to creep back into the game In the third quarter Philadelphia quarterback Timmy Brown broke through the line on a fiveyard score bringing the score to 2820 Undeterred Jurgenson found Charley Taylor in the end zone on a 25yard touchdown completing his revenge game October 30 1966 Redskins win 2713 The 1966 season signaled a new chapter in professional football The AFL and NFL merged and the following season would determine which teams would compete for the very first Super Bowl A 33 start for the Redskins meant a win against the Eagles would be crucial if the team wanted to make the onegame playoff Both teams got off to a slow start trading field goals for the first three quarters At the start of the final quarter the game was tied at 13 Jurgensen saved the day with two touchdown passes to Mitchell and Jerry Smith November 7 1971 Tie 77 Washington started the 1971 season 50 on its way to its first playoff berth in the Super Bowl Era Halfway through the season the Redskins had just one loss and were looking towards a firstplace finish in the NFC East The Eagles foiled those plans in a brutal defensive game Quarterback Billy Kilmer stepped in for an injured Jurgensen with little success Kilmer threw four interceptions to the Eagles defense and only managed a touchdown late in the fourth quarter to keep Philadelphia from securing a win The Redskins later lost in the divisional round of the playoffs against the San Francisco 49ers October 8 1972 Redskins win 237 After the tie in 1971 Washington went on to beat Philadelphia seven times in a row The 1972 season remains one of the Redskins most dominant The team won nine straight games after starting 21 By this time an improved Kilmer had stepped into a fulltime starting role He led his team past the Eagles throwing 155 yards and a score Washington would lose its final two games of the regular season but dominated the Green Bay Packers and Dallas Cowboys in the playoffs The Miami Dolphins however prevented the Redskins from winning their first Super Bowl September 27 1976 Redskins win 2017 OT Washington prevailed in the first of four overtime games in its series against the Eagles Kilmer and the Redskins passing attack faltered leading to a 10point deficit in the second quarter The defense prevented disaster when Brad Dusek returned an Eagles fumble 32 yards for a touchdown Philadelphia quarterback Mike Boryla threw the final touchdown of regulation tying the game at 17 A Mark Moseley field goal in overtime though gave Washington its third straight win of 1976 September 12 1982 Redskins win 3734 OT The 1982 season ended in epic fashion for Washington as the team won its first Super Bowl in franchise history after going 81 in the regular season The Redskins prevented an 01 start to their historic run in the season opener against the Eagles The arm of quarterback Joe Theismann saved Washington from trouble The fourthyear Redskins starter tossed 382 yards and three touchdowns Theismann brought his team back from a 10point deficit and led the offense down the field for the gamewinning field goal in overtime November 12 1990 Eagles win 2814 Most Washington and Philadelphia fans remember this one The infamous Body Bag Game left the Washington roster decimated With quarterback Mark Rypien sidelined with an injury the Redskins were already at a disadvantage Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan made sure that continued During the Monday Night slugfest nine Washington players left the field because of injuries and one of the Philadelphia players shouted if the Redskins needed any more body bags to carry off hurt players Both of Rypiens backups were knocked out of the game leaving rookie running backreturner Brian Mitchell to try and survive Mitchell did his best to keep Washington competitive but the wounded team was eventually overwhelmed and lost 2814 January 5 1991 Redskins win 206 The Body Bag Game would be the second of three meetings between the Redskins and Eagles in the 1990 season The third came in the first round of the playoffs the only postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals Far from explosive the Redskins steadily cut down the Eagles early lead scoring 20 unanswered points to move on to the Divisional Round before eventually winning the Super Bowl September 19 th 1993 Eagles win 3431 The Eagles looked to be on the rise in their third straight win of 1993 Neither team gained an edge in the first three quarters with the score being tied with a little more than nine minutes left in the game An 85yard run by Reggie Brooks put Washington up 3124 and it looked like the Redskins would earn the W but a late filed goal put the Eagles within striking distance With four seconds left quarterback Randall Cunningham found Calvin Williams for a 10yard touchdown winning the game for Philadelphia November 28 1999 Redskins win 2017 OT Rookie Donovan McNabb had already stolen a win against the Redskins two weeks before McNabbs first trip to Washington ended with the rookie recording 243 yards of total offense The Redskins jumped out to a 10point lead but McNabb threw two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to tie things up at 17 The Redskins staved off the Eagles behind the leg of Brett Conway on a 27yard field goal in overtime November 6 2005 Redskins win 1710 Philadelphia head coach Andy Reid brought a winning mentality to the City of Brotherly Love The Eagles reached the postseason nine times during his tenure Philadelphia won seven consecutives matchups against Washington during the first half of the 2000s The Redskins finally snapped the streak one year after the Eagles reached the Super Bowl After Washington snatched a 1710 lead the Eagles offense stalled in the fourth quarter The Redskins defense ended any hope for a McNabb comeback when Ryan Clark came down with an interception with less than three minutes left in the game November 18 2012 Redskins win 316 The 2012 season ended unexpectedly for Washington After drafting quarterback Robert Griffin III with the secondoverall pick the Redskins went 36 before their Week 10 bye A matchup with a 36 Eagles team was exactly what Washington needed to jumpstart the season The defense overpowered quarterback Nick Foles who was picked off twice and fumbled three times Meanwhile Griffin threw for 200 yards and four touchdowns without an interception and ran for an additional 84 yards Washington ended the regular season with seven straight wins reaching the playoffs for the first time since 2007 December 20 2014 Redskins win 2724 Washington helped foil Philadelphias plans for the postseason with a close win late in the year Surprisingly fullback Darrel Young carried the Redskins offense with two rushing touchdowns

the Eagles scored a 3017 Week 1 victory at FedExField in Landover Md and it could come down to the quarterback play While Philadelphia struggled to run the ball against Washingtons defense quarterback

escaped two different Redskins to launch a 58yard bomb for a touchdown After the game the Redskins spoke of the frustration of not getting Wentz down but admitted theyd learn from their mistakes from not taking down the secondyear quarterback Quarterbacks who can move around like that and make throws on the run it puts us in a tight spot but we have to make more plays said linebacker Mason Foster at the time We were right there We will go look at it and get it corrected and just keep getting better and try to make this the last one like that Wentzs hot start has extended through the first month and a half of the season as he enters Mondays game with 13 touchdowns to just three interceptions while passing for more than 1500 yards So stopping the quarterback wont be easy especially with uncertainty in the defensive backfield It isnt clear yet whether cornerbacks Josh Norman rib and Bashaud Breeland knee will play Itll be a great challenge because hes playing extremely well said Redskins head coach Jay Gruden Theyre 51 for a reason and hes a major part of that Hes got a great rapport with the receivers right now Theyre playing at a high level so our guys will have to step up

had three turnovers including two crucial mistakes in the fourth quarter First Cousins threw an interception in the red zone on third down at a time when the Redskins were only trailing by two points Then after the defense held the Eagles to a field goal late the Redskins had an opportunity to win the game with less than two minutes left trailing by only five But on a 2 nd and3 dropback from Cousins the quarterback had the ball jarred from his possession The Eagles grabbed his fumble and turned it into a touchdown Since that performance though Cousins has been among the best quarterbacks in the league Hes thrown eight touchdowns to just one interception in Washingtons last four games Cousins has also been able to keep opposing defenses on their toes by dispersing the ball to multiple targets Six different Redskins have at least 11 receptions on the season I think any time we have a route combination I think he trusts everybody involved in the pattern and hes seeing things pretty clearly getting to his right reads and right progressions Gruden said this week Its all about reading the defenses going through your progressions and the line giving him time and then trusting the guys to make the plays for you Grimm asks hailmail fatrob a go We wont know Rob Kelley s game status until Saturday afternoon when the Redskins complete the week of practices but Gruden did say this week that the running back will return practice after not participating at all last week Kelley of course did not play in last Sundays victory over the San Francisco 49ers as he still wasnt quite at full strength In his place the Redskins once again relied on the combination of Samaje Perine and Chris Thompson The two running backs combined for 56 rushing yards on 25 carries while Kirk Cousins chipped in 26 rushing yards and a score on the ground as well Perine also scored his first NFL touchdown on a threeyard reception from the quarterback Kelley has been slowed by rib and ankle injuries so far this year as he did not play against either the 49ers or Oakland Raiders He was also removed from games against the Los Angeles Rams and Kansas City Chiefs as well So the only game hes been fully healthy in this year was the regular season opener against the Philadelphia Eagles His return though could help a Redskins offense thats going against the leagues No 1 rush defense as the Eagles allow just 657 yards on the ground per game Thats nearly five yards less than any other team in the NFL The Eagles havent allowed any running backs to come close to 100 yards on the ground and limited the Carolina Panthers running backs to just one yard on 13 carries last week Now if Kelley cant play on Monday night Gruden remains confident that Perine can be effective in the Tulane products place After not recording a single offensive snap in Washingtons first game against Philadelphia Perine has recorded 55 carries for 166 yards over the Redskins last four contest The more opportunities he gets the better he is going to get Gruden said He is not a finished product by any stretch He is a rookie He is feeling himself through it but I am just looking for more decisive cuts by him and more physical runs Thats just what we expect from Samaje and I know he expects that himself',\n",

       " 'One of the most improved units on the Redskins the defensive line lost a crucial part of its rotation with Jonathan Allen s recent injury Theyll need to fill the void against the firstplace Eagles Arguably the biggest upgrade to the Redskins defense this season has been the defensive line The unit underwent a reboot this past offseason bringing in two free agent veterans in Stacy McGee and Terrell McClain and making its biggest splash in the draft selecting Jonathan Allen in the first round The emergence of Matt Ioannidis in his second year has helped transform the pass rush and produced a ripple effect for the rest of the defense The depth and talent of the line will be tested this Monday night in a primetime matchup with the Eagles however now that Allen will be gone for at least eight weeks of the season The Redskins placed him on Injured Reserve with a Lisfranc injury that he suffered against the 49ers last Sunday and will have to lean on others to fill the void We miss a guy thats willing to communicate with you and willing to get better an unselfish guy and able to take coaching and get better and understand his role and job out there especially when it comes to the field and stuff like that defensive lineman Ziggy Hood said The Redskins feared that Allen could be lost for the entire season because injuries to the Lisfranc can be extremely difficult to rehab especially for a 288pound lineman He could be eligible to return Week 15 against the Arizona Cardinals We got better news after the surgery that it wouldnt be as lengthy as some of these surgeries typically are So thats good news but we still have to rehab it head coach Jay Gruden said He is a big man and sometimes bigger guys take a little bit longer but we will wait and see We will just play it by ear and hopefully we see him again but it is up to the rehab The Redskins will likely lean on secondyear defensive lineman Anthony Lanier II who has been on the 53man roster for the entire season but has been inactive for all five games He played in four games last season year before an injury sidelined him for the rest of the year and he will have a daunting task facing an Eagles team that ranks in the Top10 in nearly every offensive category most notably they lead the league in third down conversions Very excited Lanier said of his opportunity You know keeping the pressure on Wentz is going to be big for us so getting everybody together and lets go do this Its bad that we had to lose Allen but we have got a lot of guys on the roster that are going to fill that spot defensive coordinator Greg Manusky said It is not going to fill it totally like Allen would but Anthony has been doing a pretty good job We are going to mix in and out different guys to see what those guys have But Lanier has been improving each and every week and we are looking forward to him getting on the field and playing the game Beside each other Ioannidis and Allen have been sparkplugs for the pass rush creating an interior push that forced quarterbacks to either flee the pocket or get swarmed by outside linebackers Thats also meant that the team has been able to rely on less blitzing letting the secondary stay in coverage and linebackers keeping an eye on running backs and tight ends The Redskins have 15 sacks on the season and they rank 11 th in the league with a 79 adjusted sack rate percentage which factors in sacks per pass attempt adjusted for down distance and opponents according to Football Outsiders Allen was a big factor in those numbers creating pushes and stunts that freed up his teammates to attack the quarterback According to Pro Football Focus Allen leads all defensive tackles with a 131 pass rush productivity mark for players with at least 30 pass rushes Hes also reached 13 quarterback pressures the most of any rookie defensive tackle on just 80 snaps Gruden remains confident in his potential replacements including AJ Francis who the team recently signed to the active roster after he was cut before the regular season Lanier is a different animal Hes a good pass rusher still young Gruden said Francis provides us some more depth as far as the interior as far as nose guard is concerned I dont know which combination we will use come Monday but it is good to get AJ back here We liked him a lot We let him go numberswise and then we are fortunate that he was on the streets so we brought him back The Redskins underneath defensive line coach Jim Tomsula have rotated their defensive line enough this season to the point that everyone has remained fresh throughout the course of games This should continue to help them in chasing down Wentz on Monday night taking more strides as a unit This room is full with a bunch of guys that arent selfish thats willing to put away egos aside play different positions that they normally dont play whether thats me playing nose Terrell McClain playing that fourtechnique and big Stacy McGee playing the fourtechnique and stuff like that Hood said So we got guys doing that are willing to fight for the guy next to him You want to push them to allow them to be better Then youve got a bunch of guys that are willing to do anything to win',\n",

The Eagles would push their lead back to two touchdowns early in the fourth quarter as Carson Wentz would throw his fourth touchdown pass of the night to cap off a nineplay 75yard drive The Redskins appeared poised to end the drive early but Wentz incredibly slipped a sack on third down to rush for a new set of downs before slicing through Washingtons secondary Washington would convert on a third down play following the touchdown as Kirk Cousins would complete his first pass of the night to Terrelle Pryor Sr Then after being sacked Cousins would find Chris Thompson on a screen pass But on his next third down throw Cousins threw a pass directly to Corey Graham for his interception of this game Philadelphia would take advantage of the turnover with a field goal conversion from 42 yards out

last drive though Third Quarter Redskins 17 Eagles 24 The Eagles got the ball to start the third quarter but suffered a big loss on the first play of the frame as Jason Peters went down before being carted away He has been ruled out for the remainder of the game On the field though Philadelphia would extends its lead with a third consecutive touchdown pass on as many drives as Carson Wentz found Corey Clement on a third down throw The Redskins offense continued to struggle moving the ball after jumping out to a 103 lead as Washingtons first drive stalled out after just six plays But just before the end of the quarter the Redskins would cut the deficit to seven On the scoring drive Kirk Cousins kept the offense going with a third down keeper while also hitting Josh Doctson on a big throw Then Cousins would connect with Jordan Reed for a 20yard gain on a 3 rd and11 pass Cousins would go back to Reed on a fiveyard touchdown pass It is the first touchdown reception on the season

50yard field goal make by Jake Elliott On second down just before the field goal Zach Brown and Mason Foster took down Carson Wentz for the Redskins second sack on the evening The Redskins would get a

to get the Redskins deep into Eagles territory Benefitting from a hands to the face penalty on Philadelphia Washington would score its first touchdown of the evening as Cousins completed a sevenyard pass to a wideopen Chris Thompson Nick Rose would hit the extra point the first of his career After exchanges short drives the Eagles would get some momentum with a nohuddle offense before Wentz launched a 64yard touchdown to Mack Hollins to tie the game at 10 The Redskins were unable to respond with points of their own with a quick threeplay possession The Eagles would put more points on the board just before halftime as Wentz completed a fouryard touchdown to Zach Ertz with 22 seconds left in the second quarter First Quarter Redskins 3 Eagles 0 The Redskins handed the ball off to Rob Kelley to start the game as the running back returned to action with a sixyard pickup before Vernon Davis quickly moved the chains with a 31yard reception Cousins would then complete a 20yard pass to Jamison Crowder but the Redskins would stall out inside the 10yard line before Nick Rose nailed his first career NFL attempt from 27 yards out On the drive Cousins was 3of4 for 57 yards The Eagles meanwhile had a bizarre start to the game with four straight penalties to open up their first offensive possession before Quinton Dunbar tallied his first interception of the season on a deep pass on 2 nd and31 Dunbar read Eagles quarterback Carson Wentzs toss perfectly to haul in the ball and give it back to Cousins and Co The offense however was forced into a threeandout before the Eagles got the ball back The Redskins though would force a threeandout of their own thanks to a third down sack of Wentz by linebacker Ryan Kerrigan Washington would start its next drive from the sevenyard line however after a Jamison Crowder punt return fumble was recovered by Joshua Holsey While the Redskins would get out of the shadows of their own goal posts off a 32yard reception from Niles Paul Tress
